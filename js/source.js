var allStories = "I arrived on Claw Island just ahead of a Risen attack and found a new ally in the scholar Trahearne. We lit beacons at the fortress to warn Lion's Arch of Zhaitan's offshore forces, and we saw the Lionguard survivors of Fort Stalwart safely back to the mainland, though our retreat came at a terrible cost. After the defeat at Claw Island, the survivors returned to Lion's Arch. It will take Zhaitan's minions some time to get reinforcements from Orr, but when they do, they will attack the city. Steward Gixx told me to meet with the other Durmand Priory operatives near the Durmand Memorial in Lion's Arch. Zhaitan's forces attacked from the beach, but we held them off. General Soulkeeper is returning to Vigil Keep to rally an army. In the meantime, Trahearne and I are going to call upon our allies across the continent. Tyria is in great danger. I reported back to headquarters, and was promoted to Magister. Gixx has a small job for us next — to retrieve some research papers from his colleague, Maeva, in Lion's Arch. On entering Maeva's house, we discovered it has been torn apart by a monstrous scout from Orr. Sieran and I are headed to Claw Island, to warn the Lionguard. I spoke with Barron and Fero about the fall of Claw Island. Their weapon would be perfect for our assault on Claw Island...if we can get it finished. Now that the weapon's complete, Barron and Fero have agreed to help us fight Zhaitan's forces at Claw Island. A resounding victory! I spoke with Tegwen and her friend, Carys, about the fall of Claw Island. Because of a cursed mirror, they'd both seen the ravages of Orr first-hand, and they were very willing to come and assist the Priory. The Pale Tree showed us a vision of Orr. Trahearne has pledged to find a way to heal that ruined land. For my part, I swear to find a way to defeat Zhaitan. These are dangerous, amazing times in Tyria's history. I hope I can live up to the Mother Tree's hopes for the future. I defended Durmand Priory from the invading armies of Zhaitan. The dragon is powerful, but like a force of nature — it lashes out where it feels resistance, in an attempt to overwhelm anything in its path. Our victory at the priory bolstered our confidence. Now, we take back Claw Island. The three Orders of Tyria met on the dock in Lion's Arch, and agreed to unify their efforts in Orr beneath a new banner: the Pact. As its first mission, Trahearne is leading us back to Claw Island, where we will attempt to retake Fort Stalwart from Zhaitan's forces. Together, the three Orders of Tyria took back Claw Island and defeated the Plaguebringer. The city of Lion's Arch is no longer in danger. With one blow, we avenged the loss of my mentor and proved that the Pact can conquer any enemy. I reported back to headquarters, and was promoted to Lightbringer. Our next mission is to find a possible double agent, Yeng Isen, before he turns traitor. He hasn't reported in some time, and the order suspects he's betrayed them. Yeng had captured an Orrian scout—inside Lion's Arch. Tybalt and I are headed to Claw Island, to warn the Lionguard. The Vigil has received reports of citizens missing in the sewers beneath Lion's Arch. Forgal and I have been sent to investigate. In investigating the sewers, Forgal and I discovered one of Zhaitan's scouts—inside the city of Lion's Arch. Now we're heading to Claw Island to warn the Lionguard. Almorra ordered me to report to Fort Marriner, the Vigil's outpost in Lion's Arch. We have to hold off the dragon's incursions for as long as we can, until the Lionguard is ready to levy a counterassault. Zhaitan's forces attacked from the beach, but we held them off. General Soulkeeper is returning to Vigil Keep to rally an army. In the meantime, Trahearne and I are going to call upon our allies across the continent. Tyria is in great danger. Galina Edgecrusher and Snarl Backdraft were reluctant to work together, but we rescued Snarl—and he convinced Galina. They'll meet us at Claw Island for our attack against the armies of Zhaitan. Trahearne and I bested Fibharr and his friends, and they agreed to join the Vigil in our fight to retake Claw Island. I defended Vigil Keep from the armies of Zhaitan. The dragon is powerful, but like a force of nature—it lashes out where it feels resistance, in an attempt to overwhelm. The victory at the keep has bolstered our confidence. Next, we retake Claw Island. My mentor and I located Gara, the wounded grawl shaman. He told us about the monster that his people have mistaken for a god. We confirmed the 'god' is a dragon minion, and we agreed to help Gara prove that to his people. Due to the opposition of the other shamans, Gara was unable to convince his people that their 'god' is just a savage beast. The grawl don't give up their gods easily, so we've decided take bold steps that will prove Gara's claims beyond any doubt. We stormed the false god's cave, defeated more of the dragon's servants, and secured the evidence we needed: grawl remains. Gara was confident these bones would be enough to prove that the grawl's offerings aren't being taken to paradise, no matter what the other shaman say. My mentor and I helped Gara overcome the other shamans' resistance and convince the grawl that their 'god' is nothing more than a ravenous dragon minion. Gara expressed a new concern, however: as soon as they realize no more offerings are coming, the hungry icebrood will come to devour everything and everyone in the village. We assured him that we will not let that happen. We killed the ice dragon minions that came to destroy Gara's village, but at a terrible cost: the village and many of the villagers were lost in the fighting. Most of Gara's people survived, however, and Gara was grateful. Having finally realized the scope of the threat the Elder Dragons pose to all of Tyria, he swore to help us in our fight against them, just as we helped him. My mentor and I established contact with Ikniu, a hylek from the village that is sacrificing its champions to the undead. We collected the head of their most recent champion as proof that the sacrifices aren't saving the village. Instead, the champions are being corrupted and joining Zhaitan's undead army. The village leaders were not convinced, however, so we decided to make our case again from a much stronger position so that no one could possibly deny the truth. We followed High Priestess Ecolotl's procession to Lorantl Grounds and confronted her with our proof of the undead corruption. She was convinced, but we soon realized that sooner or later, the undead will come to overwhelm the village. We decided to return and help the village prepare to defend itself. With Ikniu's help, I won the Tournament of the Sun God. The hylek were willing to listen to a tournament champion, and I convinced Chief Quecuan that we must defend the village from the undead, not offer sacrifices to them. High Priestess Ecolotl disagreed and stormed off, but the rest of the hylek joined in our plans to fortify and defend the village. The hylek village was destroyed, but we managed to save most of the villagers. Chief Quecuan and Ikniu were grateful, and Ikniu promised to join our fight against the Elder Dragons to repay us for joining his. I met with the chieftain of Agrak Kraal, an ogre named Lagula. She told us the kraal's previous chieftain, Uldek, went missing in the Brand, and so did the search party they sent in after him. My mentor and I agreed to enter the Brand and find out what happened to the missing ogres. We went into the Brand but didn't find the missing ogre chieftain, Uldek. We did find the search party's only surviving member, an ogre named Kokarra. She told us Uldek had become Branded and was raising a massive Branded horde to destroy Agrak Kraal. We agreed to help the kraal prepare for the coming onslaught. My mentor and I helped the ogres of Agrak Kraal tame a pack of rock dogs and their alpha, a huge brute named Sourfang. Nojara, the ogre beastmaster, said that these formidable beasts will give the kraal a much better chance of surviving the Branded attack we all know is coming. We helped the ogres of Agrak Kraal beat back a flock of local harpies to harvest the lumber we need to shore up the kraal's defenses. The ogres, my mentor, and I all agreed: we've done all we can to prepare, and when the Branded chieftain Uldek returns to destroy the kraal, Lagula and her people will be ready. We joined forces with the ogres of Agrak Kraal and defended them from the horde of Branded creatures led by their corrupted former chieftain, Uldek. The kraal was destroyed in the attack, but we did save the ogres themselves. Chieftain Lagula agreed to join our fight against the Elder Dragons as soon as she helps her people establish a new kraal to call home. Quaggan have been disappearing from Falooaloo Village, so my partner and I went to investigate. A quaggan named Shashoo and the village elder, Varonos Narrijoo, confirmed that the villagers are vanishing, but the village can't move until their clutch of eggs hatch. This made Falooaloo easy prey for whatever is hunting them, so we set out to find the missing quaggan and solve this mystery. My partner and I found Falooaloo's missing quaggans, but they had been twisted and corrupted by the Ice Dragon. These icebrood will continue to mass until they have the numbers to overwhelm the village, so we rededicated ourselves to protecting the village and giving the quaggan eggs time to hatch. Sashoo led us to Baroosh, one of the few quaggan who isn't ashamed to shift into his enraged form and fight. Baroosh took some convincing — the villagers have shunned him for years for his lack of shame— but once he saw the quaggans that had been corrupted into icebrood, he agreed to join in the defense of Falooaloo Village. I met Oldoo, a quaggan pastkeeper who knew of an ancient ritual that could protect Falooaloo Village. To prepare the ritual, we needed to employ a nearby set of jotun worship stones, which the jotun were not willing to share. We forced them to cooperate and helped Oldoo complete his preparations, and he promised to be ready to defend the village when the icebrood attack comes. We all pitched in to defend Falooaloo Village—me, my partner, Pastkeeper Oldoo, Baroosh, and even Shashoo—but the village was destroyed by the icebrood's attack. We did manage to save the quaggans themselves, including all their newly hatched eggs, and we secured the villagers' help for the coming war against the Elder Dragons. It wasn't a complete victory by any stretch, but it'll have to do: the threat of the dragons grows stronger each and every day. We've met Ftokchak, the skritt. His people have found several unusual dwarven artifacts. While we were looking at the artifacts, we realized the skritt had found something far more dangerous — eggs, created by a Destroyer. We've met Ftokchak, the skritt. His people have found several unusual dwarven artifacts. While we were looking at the artifacts, we realized the skritt had found something far more dangerous — eggs, created by a Destroyer. Ftokchak helped my mentor and I acquire the bomb powder we needed to obliterate the destroyer queen. We helped the skritt kill the destroyer queen, but their scratch was destroyed in the process. Ftokchak agreed to join our fight against the Elder Dragons once his tribe finds a new home. The remaining members of Destiny's Edge met—and it was explosive. The death of their compatriot, Snaff, caused some real rifts in the guild. It will take a lot to mend those friendships. I received a letter from Sieran, a Magister of the Durmand Priory. She's been sent to escort me to the Durmand Priory, but first we'll make a little detour, to check out rumors of a dwarven tomb. I met Sieran, and we're going to check out an old tomb on the way to the Priory. The tomb was definitely dwarven. The dredge hadn't taken everything, but they did tell us they moved an ancient weapon. They took it south to see if it could be destroyed. We reported to Gixx, the Steward of the Durmand Priory and told him everything about the dwarven tomb and the dredge. Sieran and I tracked the Sanguinary Blade to the tomb of dwarf Dagnar Stonepate, founder of the Stone Summit faction. We made our way past a series of traps only to find Steag Frostbeard and the Sons of Svanir. Frostbeard used the Sanguinary Blade to create a monster and escaped in the confusion. We decided to develop a method of containing the blade's power before we tackle Frostbeard again. We found the ancient scabbard among the ruins of a Stone Summit fortress. With this, we should be able to protect the Sanguinary Blade and keep its corruption from spreading. With a little cleverness, we tweaked a magical device from the Priory's vaults. Now, we just have to test it. The magical adjustments to the old dwarven relic worked. With this, we should be able to protect the Sanguinary Blade and keep its corruption from spreading. Sieran and I retrieved the Sanguinary Blade from Steag Frostbeard. Sieran's managed to contain the sword so it can't corrupt anyone, and now we just have to take the blade back to Gixx. Back at the Durmand Priory, we gave the Sanguinary Blade to Gixx. Hopefully, the researchers can run tests on the blood, and find some kind of weakness to us against the Elder Dragons. I've received a letter from Tybalt Leftpaw, who has been assigned to me as my new Order of Whispers contact. I need to meet him in Lion's Arch. I met Tybalt Leftpaw, a Lightbringer of the Order of Whispers. He's... unique, I'll give him that. We've got a situation to investigate in Applenook Hamlet, north of the city. I'll meet him there. Demmi Beetlestone, daughter to Legate Minister Caudecus of the Kryta, asked the Order of Whispers to give her political asylum, implying she knew something about her father that was worth finding out. The Order lost contact with Demmi somewhere in Applenook Hamlet. It appears that she's been kidnapped by Jackdaw pirates. We rescued Demmi and got her safely back to Lion's Arch. She'll be waiting for me at the safehouse there. I talked with the bouncer inside the tavern in Lion's Arch. With the proper passwords, I was allowed into the secret Order of Whispers hideout. Tybalt and Demmi arrived safely in Lion's Arch, but they were tracked via her enchanted necklace and she had to be snuck out of the city again. It was harrowing, but we got Demmi out of Lion's Arch. Thanks to Lady Wi's illusions, we tricked the Ministry Guard and found a way through to safety. We left a great big trail for the Ministry Guard. By the time they're done, they'll be so lost they won't know where the sun rises! Now, to meet up with Tybalt and Demmi at the southern safehouse. Tired of running from her father's thugs, Demmi finally stood up for herself. She joined the Order of Whispers, and together, we faced down Commander Landon—and defeated him. Due to the success of my first mission, I've been promoted to full Agent! Tybalt and I were assigned a mission to infiltrate and influence members of one of Tyria's tribal cultures. I chose my favorite, and now, we're back in action! I received a letter from Warmaster Forgal, a member of the Vigil. I'm to meet with him and the general at Fort Marriner. General Almorra has asked me to assist Warmaster Forgal on a mission to Ascalon, where the treaty at Ebonhawke is in jeopardy from renegades. The Vigil wants the peace to succeed. I assisted Warmaster Forgal and saved Ebonhawke from invading charr renegades. I found out that the renegades plan to assassinate Minister Kent Duran, of Kryta. I also found out that the renegade leader, Ajax, is Almorra's son. It must have been difficult for her to put Tyria's well being before that of her flesh-and-blood. We managed to locate and defend the Minister and the Ambassador, thus saving them from assassination. Ajax won't stop so easily, though. We'll have to make a plan to take him out—for good. Together with Sergeant Jeyne and the Ebon Vanguard, Forgal and I managed to defend the peak and defeat Ajax Anvilburn and his renegades. The treaty signing is safe, and General Almorra will be very pleased. We returned to Almorra with the good news of our successful mission in Ebonhawke. My next duty is to speak with one of the minor races. If I help solve their troubles, perhaps I can convince them to join the Vigil. Together with Sergeant Jeyne and the Ebon Vanguard, Forgal and I managed to overrun and defeat Ajax Anvilburn and his renegades. The treaty signing is safe, and General Almorra will be very pleased.

If I help solve their troubles, perhaps I can convince them to join the Vigil. After helping Zojja fend off a wave of killer Inquest golems, I deciced to show the residents of Metrica Province how a real genius gets things done. That should settle the argument over who is the premier inventor, adventurer, and intellectual paragon of our time. My krewe and I presented our entry in the Snaff Prize competition: the Very Old Energy Detector, or VOED. The judges were impressed (eventually), and Zojja herself expressed support, so we not only walked away with the Snaff Prize, my krewe voted me the title of Snaff Savant. The VOED also pointed out something very powerful in the vicinity, so we went to see exactly what our detector detected. Zojja joined my krewe as we tracked down the powerful readings we got off our VOED. We found the artifact, which seemed to be part of a larger whole. We decided to take back it to our lab for further tests. The Inquest released a flood of hostile golems to cover up a brazen daylight data theft. With the help of Zojja and Mr. Sparkles, I defeated the Inquest agents, their golems, and the monstrous Prototype X. My krewe was preparing to study the artifact detected by the VOED when the Inquest stormed our lab and threatened everyone in the area if we didn't hand it over. We did, but they didn't realize the VOED gives us an edge: namely, it can lead us to the other pieces of the artifact before they ever get close. We decided to secure the other pieces and then steal the one they extorted from us back. Zojja and I used the VOED to beat the Inquest to the next piece of the artifact, We found one in a merchant's stall in Rata Sum, though I don't think he realized what he had. Zojja did some fast talking to distract the merchant, and I collected the object. With the VOED and Zojja on my side, I decided to press on and find the next piece. Zojja and I beat the Inquest to the next piece of the relic. We also used some of our best weaponry to beat the Inquest to a pulp. We deduced that there are only three pieces of the artifact in all: the two we have plus the one the Inquest extorted from us. We decided that in order to complete our collection and assemble the full artifact, we would have to take back the Inquest's piece by force. Zojja and I got past the Inquest door puzzle and located the last piece of the artifact. Teyo tried to stop us, but we got past her, too-she won't be bothering anyone anymore. The completed artifact turned out to be the key to Gadd's laboratory-Gadd, one of the most famous and accomplished geniuses in history. We decided to see what 'ol Gadd has been keeping locked up all these years. Zojja, Mr. Sparkles, and I ambushed the Inquest caravan that was transporting the last piece of the artifact. Teyo tried to stop us with her own squad of golems, but they were no match for us. The complete artifact turned out to be a key to Gadd's lab—Gadd, one of the most impressive and famous geniuses in history. We decided to use the key and find out what secrets Gadd's lab still holds. Zojja and I used the key we found with the VOED to open the door to Gadd's lab. We saw some truly amazing things, including a whole passel of destroyers that Gadd had kept contained for who knows how long. We wiped them out and recovered Gadd's personal archive, with all his thoughts, notes, and ideas. In short, it's the find of the century, and thanks to the VOED, it's all mine. After helping Zojja fend off a wave of killer Inquest golems, I decided to show the residents of Metrica Province how a real genius gets things done. That should settle the argument over who is the premier inventor, adventurer, and intellectual paragon of our time. My krewe and I presented our Massively Impressive Golem (MIG) before the Snaff Prize judges, and they were suitably impressed — until the MIG went haywire and ran off. We still took the Snaff Prize, but none of us can claim the title 'Snaff Prize Savant' until we recover the MIG. The krewe and I used our lab's advanced machinery to track down the MIG ... which wasn't too hard to find, as it came crashing through the walls looking for Kazz. We managed to calm the MIG down, but Doxa's still fused inside. We decided to keep the MIG contained while we research a way to extract Doxa from the golem. My krewe brought in a golem expert to consult on our MIG problem — Zojja herself. The Inquest interrupted our research by trying to kill us and burn our lab down, but we handled them like fresh produce and bruised their tender flesh. Then we decided that since the Inquest is so interested in our work, we should infiltrate their lab and see if they have anything that might help us extract Doxa from the MIG. Kazz, Zojja, and I forced our way into the Funhouse and saw some of the horrific experiments they were conducting. We retrieved the information we needed, but there's no guarantee it will help Doxa. I discussed options with Kazz, and we decided that reuniting him with Doxa is worth any risk. Despite the Inquest's continued interference, we managed to extract Doxa from the MIG. We also took care of that skunk Teyo once and for all. Kazz and Doxa took a much-needed break from the action, and I was awarded the title 'Snaff Savant' by the rest of the krewe. I think I also impressed Zojja, as she promised to keep an eye on me and my progress from here on. All in all, not a bad day. Despite the Inquest's continued interference, we successfully fused Kazz with a golem so that he and Doxa could be together forever. Once they were safe, Hronk offered me the title of Snaff Savant. I took it, of course: who else is more deserving? I think I also impressed Zojja, as she promised to keep an eye on me and my progress from here on. After helping Zojja fend off a wave of killer Inquest golems, I decided to show the residents of Metrica Province how a real genius gets things done. That should settle the argument over who is the premier inventor, adventurer, and intellectual paragon of our time. My krewe's Interspatial Translocator won us the Snaff Prize, but the Inquest claimed we had stolen their designs. Councillor Flax let us keep the victory, but he gave our invention to the Inquest until an official inquiry could be conducted. Zojja spoke up for us, but to no avail. We refused to take this lying down, and with Zojja's help, we headed out to reclaim our krewe's property. Zojja and Mr. Sparkles joined Pol and I in an attempt to reclaim our translocator, but the Inquest was ready for us. That skunk Teyo used the translocator to scatter us all over the region. I was able to find Pol and Mr. Sparkles, but not Zojja. We can't just leave her in the Inquest's clutches, so we made tracking her down and rescuing her our top priority. Mr. Sparkles and I fought our way into the Funhouse to rescue Zojja. Once inside, we found she had the Inquest goons who took her either on the run or unconscious, so you could also say we rescued them from her. In any case, we helped Zojja get out of the facility and destroyed the Inquest's vile incinerator golem, into which they had been feeding test subjects who had outlived their usefulness. Then Zojja informed us that our krewe chief Varkk had been working with the Inquest all along, and that the Inquest had kidnapped Pol. I had to decide: rescue my friend and krewemate Pol, or see that the traitor Varkk gets what he deserves? Zojja, Mr. Sparkles, and I confronted Varkk just as he was about to claim his seat on the Arcane Council. We defeated his Inquest bodyguards and then administered justice to Varkk himself, Synergentics-style. With the betrayal of Pol and our entire crew avenged, we decided to take down Teyo and reclaim my krewe's Snaff Prize-winning invention. With the help of Zojja and Mr. Sparkles, I rescued Pol from the Inquest. Our traitorous krewe chief Varkk may have escaped, but I'm glad I chose to save my krewemate's life. Pol was all fired up after his ordeal, so he's joining us as we take down Teyo and recover the translocator device. Zojja and I crashed the Inquest's party and demanded the return of the translocator. Teyo refused and tried to kill us with it, but we showed her who the real geniuses were. Teyo fell, but the translocator was destroyed in the fighting. At least I was able to claim the Snaff Savant title, which everyone who matters agreed was mine by right. Zojja seemed pleased with the results, though it's often hard to tell with her. In any case, I have been confirmed as the Snaff Savant and I'm prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead. Wow, was Zojja angry! That killer VAL-A golem can't have been my fault. I'd better head to Desider Atum and find out the truth of the matter. Someone tampered with my VAL-A schematics, and built a murder-golem! Who would've done such a thing? I'd better find out, and quickly. My blueprints had been checked out three times from the Rata Sum archives, by three separate people: Mink, Keppa, and Councillor Haia. The archivist mentioned that Mink and Keppa hang out at the golem fights. Zojja and I went to the golem fights. Keppa was scavenging golem parts after each fight. Mink boasted about his powerful golem. I fought, blasted up some golem, and retrieved those modified blueprints. My analysis of the blueprints produced interesting results: Mink overpowered his golems with power stones; Keppa swapped components with salvaged parts; and Councillor Haia only changed the core…which couldn't have caused such a dramatic reaction. That narrows it down to Mink or Keppa. I located Keppa, but her golems aren't the ones putting blame on me for their mayhem. Did I err in my analysis of those modified golem blueprints? At the Seraph camp, Captain Renata had good news and bad news about Mink. The good news: she'd seen Mink. The bad news: Mink is about to sell some of his VAL-A golems to a merchant. I've got to get there and stop them in case they go berserk! Mink's malfunctioning golem almost got everyone killed! I beat up a shady merchant named Vellon, but I'm starting to think Mink isn't the one who messed with my invention. He just hasn't got the brains for it. A fresh look at Councillor Haia's VAL-A golem blueprints seems to indicate an overlooked, intentional exploit in her modifications. It's time to confront the councilor! Councillor Haia got off scot-free, but I rescued the other members of the Arcane Council from her treachery. I realize they make a practice of one-upsmanship, but this was ridiculous! Well, at least my name is cleared. I went to see Zojja at her laboratory near Rata Sum. She said that Snaff's first apprentice, Kudu, was showing off a new invention...that looks suspiciously like a rip-off of my old invention, the VAC weather-changer. Now I'm going to go see if that rat's plagiarized my work. Kudu's invention is clearly based on my design, but how to prove it? Hopefully, my schematics are still in the archives. Kudu set fire to the annex...and the backups. I'm really starting to hate that guy. Plunka tricked us! She tried to trap us in a cell, but with a sylvari named Peredur's help, we escaped. Peredur said that Kudu has a new lab and is planning to test his weather-device very soon. We investigated Kudu's testing grounds, but he managed to escape. Still, we discovered that Kudu's device is incredibly dangerous-it could permanently alter the weather in Rata Sum. I have to warn the Arcane Council! We invaded Kudu's laboratory, but he managed to escape. Still we discovered that Kudu's device is incredibly dangerous-it could permanently alter the weather in Rata Sum. I have to warn the Arcane Council! Zojja and I faced down Kudu in the Arcane Council chambers of Rata Sum. By the time we were done, everything was drenched- but the city was safe. Other than a few washed-out golems, that is. And boy, were the Arcane council...er...'grateful'. Zojja expressed interest in my very first invention, the Infinity Ball. It was supposed to predict the future, but I never got it to work exactly right. Now Zojja's interested in taking a crack at it, which I view as a huge compliment. I also met a fellow inventor named Shodd, who agreed to collaborate with me to perfect the Infinity Ball ourselves. This is a chance to redeem my first invention and test myself against Zojja, one of our greatest living geniuses, so I accepted Shodd's offer. We made plans to visit the Megahedron Collider to begin our work on the improved Infinity Ball. Shodd set up a test for my Infinity Ball at the Megahedron Collider, but the results were...problematic. After the collider supercharged the Infinity Ball, a portal opened up and strange mechanized monsters came pouring out. We took care of them, and despite some serious misgivings on my part, Shodd and I agreed to continue with our tests--In a much safer and more remote location. For safety's sake, and to keep our experiments away from prying eyes, Shodd and I took the Infinity Ball to a remote location. Once again, the test results were promising, but also unpredictable and dangerous. The Infinity Ball created an unstable portal from which emerged more hideously twisted creatures. We decided to return to my lab to determine how (and if) we should proceed. Zojja dressed us down for producing such dangerous results with the Infinity Ball. Undaunted, Shodd was still determined to go forward, and I agreed: this close to a breakthrough, a bit more risk is worth the reward. All we need is a very strong, very stable power source...and Shodd said he knew just where to get one. Shodd and I managed to obtain the power source we need from the inquest, but the plan did not go off without a hitch...in fact, like all of Shodd's plans so far, this one was decidedly hitch-heavy. As we accomplished our mission, however, we decided to press on and take the final step toward making the Infinity Ball work as it was always intended to work. I employed some quick thinking and some serious fast-talking to convince Councillor Flax's people to hand over his crozier. Now that we have the power source we need, Shodd and I are ready to take the final step and make the Infinity Ball work the way I always intended it to work: perfectly. I just hope Zojja will be more impressed than angry. Shodd and I conducted the final test on the upgraded Infinity Ball, which quickly turned into a dangerous and surreal fiasco: variant versions of ourselves from a parallel universe came through with an army of mechanical fiends, bent on conquering this world like they conquered their own. Fortunately, Zojja was there to help us fight them off. I don't think Shodd learned his lesson yet, but I did: too much ego in a genius is like too much arcano-static energy in your crystalline storage matrix- spectacular to behold, but it will inevitably blow up in your face. Zojja contacted me and asked me to attend an academic presentation by a respected professor named Gorr. She's interested in Gorr's latest theory, and after hearing her describe its potential importance, so am I. I attended an advanced theoretical conference with Zojja and representatives of the three orders of Tyria. Professor Gorr presented his theory that the Elder Dragons consume magic, which was greeted with hostility. Gorr left to collect his research notes so he could convince the crowd, but he never came back. The Arcane Eye reported that Gorr had suddenly and conveniently died before he could return, but we were not convinced. I'm going to look into Gorr's disappearance personally. I joined Agent Batanga in infiltrating Councillor Flax's office. We outsmarted his krewe chief, Filka, acquired the materials to forge the permission we needed to access Professor Gorr's lab. With our fake documents in hand, we headed for Gorr's lab to determine what happend to our missing genius. Our forged papers got us past Rakt of the Arcane Eye just long enough to verify that Professor Gorr isn't dead: there was a body at the scene, but it was not Gorr's. After Rakt grew suspicious and ran us off, we agreed to share what we've learned with Zojja and the other order reps before I decide on our next step. I met with Zojja and the order reps, and we agreed: Rakt and the Arcane Eye have obviously faked Gorr's death and have him on ice somewhere. We don't know why yet, but we decided that in order to solve this mystery, our next step is to rescue Gorr. I joined Scholar Krasso of the Durmand Priory in infiltrating Professor Gorr's lab. We faked our way past the Arcane Eye sentries and found a body bag, but the corpse inside wasn't Gorr. The professor may still be alive somewhere, so we decided to share what we've learned with Zojja and other order reps. I met with Zojja and the order reps, and we agreed: Rakt and the Arcane Eye have obviously faked Gorr's death and have him on ice somewhere. We don't know why yet, but we decided that in order to solve this mystery, our next step is to rescue Gorr. Agent Batanga and I staged a protest outside the Arcane Eye's Garrenhoff base as a way of getting arrested and brought inside. It worked perfectly: inside, we found Professor Gorr and promptly broke out again. We agreed to meet with the other order reps so they have a chance to talk to Gorr before we decide on our next move. Free once more Professor Gorr was still determined to prove his theory about the Elder Dragons eating magic. After I conferred with Zojja and the order reps, I agreed to protect Gorr from Rakt and the Arcane Eye while he collects the data he needs to verify his claims. I joined Crusader Slep in storming the Arcane Eye's hidden base where they were holding Professor Gorr captive. Rakt's agents put up a fight, but we defeated them and got Gorr out. Now we're headed back to Rata Sum to present Gorr to Zojja and the other order reps for debriefing. Free once more, Professor Gorr was still determined to prove his theory about the Elder Dragons eating magic. After I conferred with Zojja and the order reps, I agreed to protect Gorr from Rakt and the Arcane Eye while he collects the data he needs to verify his claims. Scholar Krasso and I helped prove Professor Gorr's theory by bombarding a captive dragon minion with magical energy and measuring the results. The minion grew so strong that it broke free and had to be put down, but we got our proof. We agreed to consult Zojja and the other order reps before we decide on our next course of action. All three orders of Tyria presented plans to disseminate the proof of Professor Gorr's theory. Zojja explained that whichever order's plan I chose would be the order I ";

I made my choice, and we set out to show the world that Gorr is right: dragons eat magic. For my first duty as a Durmand Priory novice, I helped Scholar Krasso stage a conference to disseminate Gorr's theory. Rakt tried to burn the place down with everyone inside, but we dealt with him...only to have Councilor Flax of the Arcane Council admit that the council knew Gorr's theory was true all along and had been stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion's Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Priory mentor is also waiting in Lion's Arch, I told her I'd look for her there. For my first duty as an Order of Whispers initiate, I helped Agent Batanga reprogram Rata Sum's Peacemaker golems to broadcast Gorr's theory far and wide. Rakt tried to kill us, but we dealt with him...only to have Councillor Flax of the Arcane Council admit that the council knew Gorr's theory was true all along and had been stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion's Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Order of Whispers mentor is also waiting in Lion's Arch, I told her I'd look for her there. I formally joined the Vigil to take down Rakt of the Arcane Eye. Crusader Slep joined me in the attack, and after a fierce battle, we were able to take Rakt down. This allowed for Professor Gorr's theory to be freely distributed, but Councillor Flax admitted that the Arcane Council had known Gorr's theory was true all along and was stifling the information until they figured out a way to exploit it. Zojja told me she was heading for Lion's Arch to meet up with an old friend, and since my new Vigil mentor is also waiting in Lion's Arch, I told her I'd look for her there. I helped Yahala and the Durmand Priory locate and destroy the dragon crystal. We also defeated the necromancer Rissa and the undead monstrosity that she made out of my dead warbandmate, Howl the Brazen. Yahala told me that my new Priory mentor is waiting in Lion's Arch, and I agreed to go there to begin my training as a Priory novice. I helped Korukhan and the Order of Whispers destroy the dragon crystal. We also defeated the necromancer Rissa and the undead monstrosity she made out of my dead warbandmate, Howl the Brazen. Korukhan told me that my new Order of Whispers mentor is in Lion's Arch, and I agreed to go there to begin my training as a Whispers initiate. When the Priory team faltered, the Vigil team stepped in to finish the job. With Rytlock's help, Gahn and I defeated the necromancer Rissa and destroyed the dragon crystal...and put the undead monstrosity that used to be Howl the Brazen to rest. Gahn told me that my new Vigil mentor will be waiting for me in Lion's Arch, and I agreed to check in to begin my training as a Vigil recruit. I helped Yahala Scribepaw test the Priory's latest invention, a device that can detect the necromancer Rissa's amulets. Yahala and I decided to return to Hero's Canton meet with Rytlock and the other order reps to put a stop to the necromancer's plans once and for all...and to find out what really happened to Howl the Brazen's body. At Rytlock's suggestion, I joined one of the orders of Tyria permanently. We both agreed that this is the best and most effective way to battle the Elder Dragons, and to put a stop to the necromancer Rissa and her amulets. It's also the surest way to find out what happened to my missing dead warbandmate, Howl the Brazen, so that he can finally rest in peace. I helped Gahn Towerbreaker defend the Vigil keep from the horde of undead Rissa's amulet summoned. I've decided to check back in with Rytlock and the other order reps. This has gone far enough, and it's way past time to find Rissa, destroy her and her amulets, and find out what happened to Howl the Brazen. At Rytlock's suggestion, I joined one of the orders of Tyria permanently. We both agreed that this is the best and most effective way to battle the Elder Dragons, and to put a stop to the necromancer Rissa and her amulets. It's also the surest way to find out what happened to my missing dead warbandmate, Howl the Brazen, so that he can finally rest in peace. Order of Whispers Agent Korukhan and I raided a dredge mine that had been attacked and depopulated by the Inquest. We defeated the Inquest and acquired their research about the necromancer Rissa's amulets before we decided to check back in with Rytlock and the other order reps to plan our next move. I reported to Rytlock and the other order reps to share the information the Order of Whispers' Korukhan and I took from the Inquest. We all agreed the amulets were even more dangerous than we first suspected, and decided my next step is to continue working with the orders to find the amulets we know about before they can do any more harm. I helped the Durmand Priory conduct a series of tests on one of Rissa's amulets. The tests all ended violently, but in the process we learned a few of the amulet's secrets: each piece of the crystal is connected, each piece is dangerous, and the pieces react violently to certain alchemical potions. We then decided to return to check in with Rytlock and the other order reps to share what we've learned. I reported to Rytlock and the other order reps to share the information the Priory's Yahala Scribepaw and I took from the Inquest. We all agreed the amulets were even more dangerous than we first suspected, and decided my next step is to continue working with the orders to find the amulets we know about before they can do any more harm. I teamed up with Korukhan of the Order of Whispers to track down Klaes, a norn who had one of the necromancer Rissa's amulets. Klaes was corrupted and insane and had to be put down, but we did establish a connection between the amulet and the sudden surge of undead. Korukhan and I decided to check in with Rytlock and the other order reps before we proceed. With help from the Order of Whispers, I proved that amulets much like the one owned by Howl the Brazen are definitely involved in a sharp increase in undead activity all across the region. We decided that more information was required, so I agreed continue to work with all three orders to dig deeper into this mystery. I went with Gahn Towerbreaker and the Vigil to investigate the disappearance of my fallen comrade's body. We travelled to Snowdrift Haven and fought off an undead raiding party. We also recovered an amulet much like the one Howl used to wear. The amulets are connected to the necromancer Rissa, so we decided to check in with the other orders before we proceed. With help from the Vigil, I proved that amulets much like the one owned by Howl the Brazen are definitely involved in a sharp increase in undead activity all across the region. We decided that more information was required, so I agreed to continue to work with all three orders to dig deeper into this mystery. Rytlock called me in to promote me to centurion and to give me a new assignment: the orders of Tyria are on the trail of a necromancer called Rissa. Rissa may have infected my fallen comrade, Howl the Brazen, so Rytlock wanted me to be involved, and to join the order reps at Howl's grave. I met with representatives of the Vigil, the Order of Whispers, and the Durmand Priory at Howl's grave. There was no body, but there was a swarm of undead grubs. Someone took Howl's body and the necromancer's amulet he was buried with, so I decided to work with one of the orders to find out who did it and why and to make sure they suffer for trifling with my warband. The Flame Legion's Mergath Flarekin launched an attack on all the Black Citadel's tribunes, as well as Imperator Smodur himself. I defeated the Flame effigy Mergath summoned and saved the Citadel's highest-ranking officers. Forktail and I stormed the Abandoned Caverns and stopped Mergath's Ritual. I believe Forktail has redeemed himself, and so I will appeal to Rytlock to have my sire's sentence reduced. I reported the results of my mission to Rytlock. After I explained how my sire redeemed himself, and how instrumental he was to my success, Rytlock agreed to release him from stockade. I returned to the stockade to speak with my father, but the Flame Legion had already broken him out. Did he go willingly, or did they take him? Either way, Warden Seneca and I are going to get him back. Seneca the Jailer and I took Forktail back from the Flame Legion. I had a tough decision to make: go with Vallus to disrupt the Flame Legion ritual threatening the Black Citadel brass, or lock Vallus up again and defend the tribunes and imperator personally. I made my choice, and now I have to make sure that no harm comes to the High Legions' leaders. I lured the Flame Legion out and discovered their plan: shaman Mergath Flarekin is targeting the Black Citadel's tribunes. I need to talk to my father again for more info on Mergath. I reported to Tribune Rytlock Brimstone, who had an unusual mission for me: my sire Clement Forktail, a Flame Legion traitor, wants to turn himself in and share vital information. Clement will only turn himself in to me, so I'm going out to bring my father back for debriefing and Black Citadel justice. My sire Clement Forktail was waiting to turn himself in to me, but there Flame Legion assassins tried to kill him before he could share what he knows. My warband and I defeated the assassins and I sent Forktail back to the Black Citadel to be interrogated. I spoke with my father, Clement Forktail, in the Black Citadel stockade. He was eager to prove he's left the Flame Legion behind, and he told me how to contact the Flame Legion so I can continue my investigation. I volunteered to fight Vallus in the arena—whatever his crimes, he deserved to die fighting, not butchered like a helpless animal. He fought with honor, but in the end I defeated him. I will remember my father not as a deserter, but as a soldier who refused to leave a member of his warband behind. Vallus didn't deserve the painful death Emer had planned, so I freed him. Emer could've let him go, but instead she chose to die trying to stop us. Ultimately, Rytlock Brimstone backed my decision. As far as Tribune Brimstone and the Black Citadel are concerned, the matter is closed. I tracked my father all the way from Loreclaw Expanse to the ransom drop. I found him just as he was about to trade the idol of Balthazar for his captured comrade. The Separatists never intended to honor their end of the deal, so we had to fight our way clear. The idol of Balthazar was destroyed, but we did manage to save the hostage. Now Vallus is in custody, and we are taking him back to the Citadel to receive his sentence: death in the Bane arena. For his crimes, Vallus has been sentenced to a painful and humiliating execution in the Bane. I think he deserves better, and after I spoke with him and Emer in the stockade, I decided to intervene. Emer Whipmane and I tracked my father to Loreclaw Expanse. We questioned his norn friend Fibharr Yogsson, who told us that the ogres stole the human idol Vallus needs to ransom his comrade back from the Human Separatists. We're heading for the ogre's kraal to retrieve both Vallus and the idol. We found Vallus Smokemane in a running battle with the ogres. We helped him, but during the commotion he grabbed the idol of Balthazar and ran off. He means to hand it over to Human Separatists at ransom for his comrade, but Emer and I are going to stop this exchange and take Vallus into custody. My father, Vallus Smokemane, has deserted his warband. Rytlock sent me to track Vallus down and bring him back alive. My first stop is in Human's Lament, where I will speak to Emer Whipmane, my father's legionnaire. I reported my success to Tribune Brimstone: with both halves of the key, I can now claim my sire's legacy. He told me to call him Rytlock and will accompany me to see this mystery solved. I'll meet him at Grendich Ruins and together we'll see what my sire left for me. Rytlock joined me in Grendich Ruins, and together, we fought through ghost to the treasure. The chest contained a Diessa Chalice, perhaps the last of its kind. I will treasure it for its value and as a remainder of my sire, Argus Foolkiller. The scrappers did steal my sire's key, but they didn't want to give it back, so my warband and I kicked them around until they were in a more cooperative mood. Now, I have to check in with Tribune Brimstone, then travel to Grendich Ruins to recover my treasure. I struck a bargain to get my sire's key back. In return for my help with a salvage operation, the scrappers Isola and Braugit will return what's mine. I protected the scrappers from ghost cows while they dug up their salvage. They returned the second half of my sire's key, and now I have to reach Grendich Ruins and claim my inheritance. I searched Lamia Mire, but someone beat me to the second half of the key. Whoever took it smashed open the chest. I'll go see if Tribune Brimstone has any advice. Tribune Brimstone believed a scrapper crew took the second half of my sire's key. At his suggestion, I headed to Charrgate Haven to find the scrappers and take back what's mine. Rytlock Brimstone gave me a letter that my sire, Argus Foolkiller, wrote on his deathbed. It mentioned a treasure hidden at Grendich Ruins and where to find the key that unlocks it. With Brimstone's permission, I went looking for the pieces of the key. I explored Windrock Maze and found the first half of the key mentioned in my sire's letter. I'm going to Lamia Mire to find the second half. I helped Blood Legion use my Ghostbore weaponry to defeat Warmaster Labofski and his ghost army. I also saved the life of Cimmara Pistolwhip, a hotheaded soldier who then joined my warband. I helped Ash Legion use my Ghostbore weaponry to defeat Warmaster Labofski and his ghost army. I also saved the life of Zemzer Undercut, a rookie soldier who then joined my warband. Ash and Blood Legions both wanted to make use of my Ghostbore weaponry, so I conducted field tests to determine which legion received the schematics. I made my choice—and with Warmster Labofski stirring up the ghosts near Ashford Forum, I'm about to see what my weapon can do in open combat. I tested my Ghostbore Musket with the help of Craze Steelgrinder and the Grind warband. The test results were very encouraging, and I even collected a trophy to prove how far we pushed into ghost territory. The preliminary test are now complete, and it's time to update Tribune Goreblade. I collected parts to build a working prototype of my weapon. The Flame Legion tried to stop me again, but I defeated them with the help of a gladium named Luccia Wildeye. After the fight, Luccia joined my warband and set up a proving ground where I can test the prototype. I updated Tribunes Gorbleade and Brimstone on my progress, and reported on the Flame Legion's interest in my weapon prototype. Brimstone's keeping a close eye on all Flame Legion activity, so he's coming to observe my weapon's next field test. I talked to Scout Fursta Farhunter, and she directed me to those who needed help around the area. I gave aid where I could. Tribune Goreblade is interested in my ideas for anti-ghost weaponry… but so is the flame Legion. They tried to steal my designs, but my warband and I fought them off. Now I'm heading for the scrapyard to salvage the parts I need to build a working prototype. I was ordered into action alongside Tribune Rytlock Brimstone. Together, we stopped Duke Barradin's attack on Smokestead. My warband went on our first big Legion operation, and as a legionnaire, I led the warband to victory. We destroyed the Flame Legion rearguard, making their main force easy pickings for Rytlock and the Black Citadel's defenders. I think this is the beginning of something big. After I recruited a new soldier for my warband, Rytlock told me that the traitorous Rage Steeltongue has been seen inside the Black Citadel. We'd better find him before he causes serious trouble. Rytlock and I stopped Rage Steeltongue from sabotaging the Black Citadel's defenses. Rage was working with the Flame Legion, so they must be planning something big. I helped Fyon the Wraith, a veteran ghost-hunter, defeat the spirit of Warmaster Kaylar. Fyon's an older charr, and he was feeling like he didn't have much more to contribute. I showed him that he can still be useful, and together we avenged his fallen comrades. In gratitude, Fyon has agreed to join my warband. The Flame Legion and I tried to recruit Soure Doomsday, a talented young magic-user. Soure agreed to join my warband, and the Flame Legion objected, but we forced them to accept his decision. Steelbane was furious when I didn't bring him his supplies, so he sent me to the Bane to fight for my life. I defeated all comers, but then Steelbane himself challenged me — and I defeated him, as well. Now I'm legionnaire of this warband! Cerosi and Rage didn't like it, and returned to being gladium. Good riddance. I spoke with Scout Fursta Farhunter and helped the Legions in Ashford. I returned to the barracks. Legionnaire Steelbane blamed me for the casualties we'd suffered in Smokestead, and ordered his new recruits to rough me up. I won the fight, but now I'm on supply runs and other cub duty until further notice. I went to Tela Range to collect supplies for Steelbane and found Flame recruiters bullying a fellow Blood Legion soldier. I helped her fight them off, but the supplies were destroyed in the process. Now I have to report back to Steelbane empty-handed. Rytlock Brimstone helped me take out Trybulus Griefblade before that rat could share the information he tortured out of poor Fengar Cruelmane. The Flame Legion remains a threat, but I've proven myself as a leader, gained Rytlock's approval, and strengthened my warband for the challenges to come. The Flame Legion has kidnapped Ash Tribune Desertgrave! Sicaea the Shrouded is standing by to help me locate Desertgrave and bring her home. I rescued Tribune Desertgrave, but the mastermind behind her kidnapping, Trybulus Griefblade, escaped justice. Trybulus is too dangerous to roam free—Rytlock Brimstone plans to help me find Trybulus and make him pay for crimes against the legions. I found Samona Ironclaw, an Iron Legion soldier, to help me protect their new siege engine from the Flame Legion. Sadly, taking me into a classified warehouse got her kicked out of the Iron Legion, but she cheerfully joined my warband without missing a beat - or a syllable. I helped Wroda the Quick stop the assassination of Blood Legion Centurion Volante Tornpaw. However, Wroda had to blow her cover as Blood and reveal she was an Ash Legion spy. I recruited Wroda into my warband; Blood Legion's loss was my gain. The Flame Legion is planning simultaneous attacks on Blood and Iron, designed to turn them against each other. Tribune Desertgrave needs this information right away. Tribune Desertgrave believes the Ash Legion can stop Flame attacks on Blood and Iron. I've been ordered to stop one attack, while Fengar Cruelmane stops the other. Flame Legion assassins attacked Tribune Desertgrave within the Black Citadel itself! After we terminated them, she sent me to contact her agend, Sicaea the Shrouded, at the Serrated Blade Tavern. Time to initiate counterespionage. Sicaea the Shrouded and I secured the password to the Flame Legion's camp. I reported back to Torga Desertgrave. Rytlock Brimstone wanted in, but Desertgrave would not let him or the Blood Legion contribute any more to the operation. She's determined to make it exclusively Ash Legion infiltrating the enemy. With help from my Order, Logan and I stopped Kellach before he could hurt Queen Jennah. Now, I will travel to Lion's Arch to meet one of Logan's old friends. Thereafter, I begin my new adventures—with the Durmand Priory! With help from my Order, Logan and I stopped Kellach before he could hurt Queen Jennah. Now, I will travel to Lion's Arch to meet with one of Logan's old friends. Thereafter, I begin my new adventures—with the Order of Whispers! With help from my Order, Logan and I stopped Kellach before he could hurt Queen Jennah. Now, I travel to Lion's Arch to meet one of Logan's old friends. Thereafter, I begin my new adventures—with the Vigil! I gained the trust of Captain Barnicus and crew and learned that Kellach met with Alastia Crow, their seer, and was corrupted when he scryed too deeply into Orr. Apparently, Crow told him that he needed royal blood to undo the corruption, so he killed her and sank the 'Ravenous.' I need to warn Logan that Queen Jennah is in danger! I returned home and spoke with Captain Thackeray. Once again, the Order representatives had good ideas about how to proceed. Logan believes it's time for me to join one of the Orders of Tyria, and I agreed. Although we had to fight off creatures pouring through the portals to the Mists, we finally summoned the spirit of Alastia Crow. According to her, Kellach was obsessed with protecting Kryta, and wanted to use her scrying powers. He used them to look into Orr and something there corrupted him. When he demanded a cure, she bluffed that only 'blood of great power and significance' would work. Enraged by this, he killed her. If he still wants that cure, there's only one thing it could be—killing the queen! We need to let Logan know right away. I returned home and spoke with Captain Thackery. Once again, the Order representatives had good ideas about how to proceed. Logan believes it's time for me to join one of the Orders of Tyria, and I agreed. Triskell Quay was under attack by undead when I arrived. We helped the guards in the area, and their lieutenant told us that a soldier named Kellach had stopped at the outpost. He left in the night to look for the pirate captain Alastia Crow. I discussed the next course of action with the Order representatives, and chose a direction for the investigation. I hope we discover the cause of these problems soon. I followed the soldier's trail northeast along the way to Black Haven. If I hurry, I can catch him before he does more harm. Following Kellach's trail, I learned an important bit of information: what drives him forward in his search to find Alastia Crow. Perhaps one of the Orders knows more about her. I discussed the next course of action with the Order representatives. Thanks to the Mortus Virge, Josir and I were able to pass safely through Lychcroft Mere, where we found several children hiding from the undead. They told us they'd seen a Seraph soldier in the swamp, doing something creepy. I should consult with the rest of the Order Representatives. I met with the three orders and learned about a missing Seraph named Kellach. The Vigil and Order of Whispers each had their own ideas about what we should do next, but it was up to me to decide. I accompanied the Vigil knights into Lychcroft Mere, where we found children hiding from the undead. They'd seen a Seraph soldier in the swamp, doing something... creepy. I should consult with the rest of the Order representatives. I met with the three orders and learned about a missing Seraph named Kellach. The Vigil and Order of Whispers each had their own ideas about what we should do next, but it was up to me to decide. Logan needs a favor. There are three Orders of Tyria: the Durmand Priory, the Order of Whispers, and the Vigil. The Priory and the Vigil are arguing over jurisdiction in a search for missing children. Logan asked me to help find the children and be an arbitrator between the two groups. Villagers around Lychcroft Mere often go into the swamp and gather moss to burn in the fireplace. Logan says the undead roam the swamp. If that's true, those villagers could be in great danger. I'd better look into it. I made my way to the carnival's big show and, as expected, the Ringmaster was preparing for his performance. It was a difficult battle, and the Ringmaster attempted to use brainwashed innocents against me, but in the end, I brought him to justice. Captain Thackeray offered me his sincere thanks for my part in continuing to protect the people of Divinity's Reach. I made my way to Uzolan's workshop. Unfortunately, the Ringmaster's hypnotized carnies arrived before I did. I defeated them and rescued Uzolan. The inventor told me that the Ringmaster is planning to use his grizwhirls to brainwash the masses at the next big performance in Divinity's Reach. Along with the other recruits, I met with the Ringmaster in the forest. It turned out to be a trap. The Ringmaster wanted to test the effects of the Floating Grizwhirl. It hypnotized the recruits. I had to beat them back to their senses. The Ringmaster is going to use the Floating Grizwhirl to hypnotize the audience at the next big show in Divinity's Reach. I have to stop him. I convinced the carnival performers to trust me by besting them at their own games. Once they let me inside, I found Garand—and the dangerous toy they've created, the grizwhirl. It has the power to hypnotize subjects and make them do terrible things. When I returned to Captain Thackeray's office, he had a favor to ask. Children from the orphanage were given a free day at the carnival. At the end of the day, one was missing. Thackeray wants me to help the Seraph find the child. While looking for the boy, I was attacked by carnies. Although I didn't find Garand, there's something suspicious about those multi-colored tents. I should tell Logan. I reported in to Logan, and he believes the only way to find the boy is to infiltrate the carnies. In order to do so, I'll need to head to their training grounds near Beetletun. We attacked the bandit camp and found the survivors of Falcon Company. I was reunited with my sister at last. I'm so glad to see her again! Though her ordeal was a difficult one, she'll be safe now, in Divinity's Reach. Captain Logan and I told the queen what we learned. Minister Arton protests his innocence, of course. We must gain more evidence of his guilt before we can take him to trial, so I'm going to speak with a former member of Tervelan's command that might know more. Sergeant Hal said that he left Tervelan's command after the Screaming Falcons were ambushed. He directed me toward a Lionguard that was once a member of the company. She might know more. Corporal Dansky, now Deputy Dansky, told me that she carried messages for Tervelan — including information on the Screaming Falcon's patrol route. Dansky believes that any surviving members of the Screaming Falcons might be at the bandit camp to the east. Sergeant Bigsby and I were set up by Captain Tervelan, but we escaped his trap. When I caught up with Tervelan, he confessed that Minister Arton was the mastermind behind the ambush of Falcon Company. I took Harrinton's journal to Captain Thackeray. He's not convinced that Tervelan is a traitor, but thinks we should question him about the Screaming Falcons. Tervelan tried to run when we asked him about the Screaming Falcons, but Captain Thackeray and I caught him. He told us that he betrayed the Seraph on the orders of Minister Arton. We have to warn the queen! Captain Thackeray asked me to investigate the veracity of Willem Harrinton's journal. He was a member of my sister's Seraph company, the Screaming Falcons. The journal casts doubt on the report of their deaths. Captain Tervelan has a pessimistic view of my investigation. He insists that all members of the Falcon Company are long dead. I offered to help his soldiers attack a nearby centaur camp, just so I can have a look around it. I met with Salia and Mehid. The information they found in the archives led us to and old, ruined home. There, I found a family graveyard, and visited the last resting place of my parents. With the help of Captain Thackeray, Exemplars Salia and Mehid, and a group of brave Seraph, we raided the cultist-led camp and destroyed the White Mantle. Afterwards, Salia and Mehid told me they may have found my parents' last place of residence. They‘re coming with me to investigate. I worked with the Shining Blade and Captain Thackeray to lure the White Mantle cultists into a trap and defeated them. Afterwards, Exemplars Mehid and Salia told me they may've found my parents' last place of residence. They're coming with me to investigate. I met with Mehid and Salia outside the hunting lodge, and we broke open the cult. Apparently, the White Mantle is hiding behind bandit activities. They incite the impoverished citizens of Kryta, and use them to act against the Queen's servants. I returned to Captain Thackeray and showed him the list. He was very concerned, and we created a plan of attack against these bandits and their cult. I received a mysterious message, promising information about my parents if I met with the anonymous sender. It's risky, but this could be my only chance to know what really happened to them. I met up with the mysterious informant, only to find an ambush! With the help of Salia and Mehid, agents for the Shining Blade, I managed to defeat the assassins. Salia and Mehid believe that the assassins are actually White Mantle cultists tied to an investigation they were pursuing. They agreed to take me on their next mission: to break into a cultist cell. Captain Thackeray and I set a trap for Two-Blade Pete-and I was the bait. I fought Pete's gang members until Pete arrived. When he did, Thackeray and the Seraph ambushed him. Together, Logan and I put an end to Two-Blade Pete and his gang. I decided to go with Logan to protect the well, and we thwarted the poisoners' plans. The bandits told me Two-Blade Pete had killed Quinn. I wish I could have saved him, but I had to do what I thought was right. I rescued Quinn from Two-Blade Pete...again. Pete was furious and will undoubtedly retaliate. I've arranged a meeting with Captain Thackeray at the tavern. If anyone can help us stop Pete, it's the captain. The Seraph archer told about a bandit cave down by the lake. The gang didn't recognize the disguised me, which made it easy to infiltrate them. Eventually, I found out they plan to poison the city's water supply. I need to tell Captain Thackery about this. I told Thackery that the bandits were planning to poison the water supply. I had to choose: go with him to stop the poisoners, or go save Quinn. It wasn't an easy decision. Quinn didn't show up at the tavern, but Captain Thackery and Anise were waiting for me. They knew I have a history with gangs, so they persuaded me to help them. I was injured by flying debris when the earth elemental exploded. I awoke in the care of a priestess of Dwayna, who kindly let me know that my buddy Quinn had visited me. I need to see him, but the priestess asked that I return her favor by protecting Shaemoor farmers first. They needed my help, but now I'm eager to get back home to the city. Two-Blade Pete let Quinn into the gang, but gave me the sharp-edge of a blade for my trouble. One of the scumbags talked about a plan to rob an herbalist. I better catch up with Quinn before he does something stupid. He's in over his head. Pete means business. Centaurs attacked Shaemoor today. I did my best to help defend the village. I met up with Captain Thackeray at the garrison, and together we were able to defeat the centaurs and their summoned earth elemental. Court convened to try Minister Zamon, but he immediately invoked an ancient law: the right to trial by combat. Fortunately, my second and I prevailed, justice was served, and Zamon was declared guilty...posthumously. I found enough people to testify against Zamon and make it stick. Lord Faren spotted Minister Zamon emerging from a bandit-controlled forest, and Guardsmen Reth mentioned that the Ministry Guard was often ordered away from areas where bandit raids were about to take place. Captain Thackeray and I searched Zamon's chalice, floor plans of ransacked properties, and an interesting letter from Zamon's sister, Lady Madeline, that hints at his suspicious activities. Zamon returned from the party as we were leaving, and Thackeray called him to trial right then and there, making our accusations both public and official. Cin Fursarai was hard to deal with, but I got the name of a man who bought the unusual stationary: Minister Julius Zamon. I reported my findings to Captain Thackeray. He knows Minister Zamon and is eager to find hard evidence to convict him of treason. Logan has asked me to assist the investigation. I have to decide between searching Zamon's home, or questioning people who know him. We don't have time to do both. When Faren and I went to the abandoned hideout, we had the advantage of surprise. We found prisoners locked in cages and freed them. One of the prisoners had managed to steal important papers from a bandit, including a missive ordering future attacks on the city. Captain Thackeray will want to see these documents. I was injured by flying debris when that earth elemental exploded. I awoke in the care of a priestess of Dwayna, who kindly let me know that my friend Faren had visited me. I need to see him, but the priestess asked that I return her favour by helping Shaemoor farmers first. They needed my help, but now I'm eager to get back home to the city. I returned home to a celebration in my honor. Unfortunately, bandits crashed the party. They captured my friend Faren. I caught up and rescued Faren before they could take him out of the city. Faren said he heard the bandits talking about a hideout beneath an abandoned farm in Shaemoor. Commander Serentine came to Captain Thackeray's office to break out Big Nose Ted. Unbeknownst to her, we had disguised ourselves as bandits, and we caught her in our trap. Captain Thackeray and I arrived at the hospital just as the arsonists were setting it on fire. We fought the bandits and saved the injured patients, but were too late to rescue the orphanage as well. By the time the ministry Guard arrived, everything was over. Commander Serentine always seems to show up just a little too late to catch these bandits. It's suspiciously convenient. Captain Thackeray and I arrived at the orphanage just as arsonists were setting it on fire. We fought the bandits and saved the orphans, but were too late to rescue the hospital as well. By the time the Ministry guard arrived, everything was over. Commander Serentine always seems to show up just a little too late to catch these bandits. That seems a little too convenient for me. I discovered important information from the thieves. First, the Ministry Guard has been releasing prisoners and sending them out to join a growing band of criminals. Second, the ringleader is planning an arson attack on Divinity's Reach. He's targeting either the military hospital or the orphanage. I warned Captain Thackeray about the impending attack on the orphanage and the hospital. We had to act quickly. Logan sent Lieutenant Francis with some soldiers in one direction, while he and I went in the other. I told Lieutenant Francis about Andrew's injury, but he had no medical supplies to spare. Thieves had intercepted his most recent shipment. He told me where I could find them. I was surprised to find Petra waiting for me at the bandit cave. She insisted on coming with me, and together we penetrated their defenses and found the stolen supplies. To my surprise, we also ran into Twitchy Jake, who mentioned Big Nose Ted as well. I don't know how he got out, but he should still be in prison. Lieutenant Francis was impressed that I brought back his supplies. As promised, he gave me medicine for Andrew. He recommended I tell Captain Thackeray about running into Twitchy Jake in the cave when he should still be in prison. I returned to administer the medicine to Andrew, who showed immediate improvement. He and Petra were grateful, and asked me to thank Captain Thackeray for them as well. I was injured by flying debris when that earth elemental exploded. I awoke in the care of a priestess of Dwayna, who kindly let me know that my friends Andrew and Petra had visited me. I need to see them, but the priestess asked that I return her favor by protecting Shaemoor farmers first. They needed my help, but now I'm eager to get back home to the city. I had a run-in at the tavern with a bully named Big Nose Ted. I had it under control until the Ministry Guard showed up, and Commander Serentine tried to arrest me along with the troublemakers. Luckily, Captain Thackeray vouched for me. My friend Andrew, the tavern keeper, was injured in the fight. Thackeray sent me to Lieutenant Francis for medicine from Seraph supplies. For my first official mission as a Priory novice, I helped fight off Vyacheslav's forces long enough for Priory scholars to cast a ritual of silence. The ritual prevented the dredge's Sonic Vaporizer from firing. Robbed of their fearsome new weapon, the dredge were no match for the Priory's defenders. Afterward, I said good-bye to Eir, and Prott sent me to Lion's Arch to meet my new Priory partner. For my first mission as an Order of Whispers initiate, Ifwyn and I distracted the dredge forces long enough to kill Vyacheslav himself. They quickly fell into disarray, and we were able to destroy the Sonic Vaporizer and drive them off. Afterward, I said goodbye to Eir, and Ifwyn sent me to Lion's Arch to meet my new Order of Whispers partner. For my first official act as a Vigil recruit, I joined Thurkill in defending the Durmand Priory and Ogden Stonehealer from Vyacheslav's Sonic Vaporizer. We crushed the dredge and destroyed their weapon. Afterwards, I said good-bye to Eir, and Thurkill sent me to Lion's Arch to meet my new Vigil partner. Liliana Black, the Priory's top code breaker, figured out that Vyacheslav is using a book code to encrypt messages about the sonic cannon. After learning where the source book was, Scholar Prott and I set out to find the key to this code. After obtaining the book key to the dredge code, Prott and I determined that the recipient was named Vladok. Vladok is a dredge currently in the stronghold Underburg, so we went to find him and force him to tell us what he knows about the sonic weapon. Prott and I learned that the ultimate target of the dredge cannon is Ogden Stonehealer, an ancient dwarf of living stone. Ogden resides inside the Durmand Priory itself, so the whole thing could be in danger. We rushed back to Hoelbrak with this information and talked to the other order reps about stopping Vyacheslav's attack. I met with Eir and the Orders of Tyria to plan how we'd stop Vyacheslav's mad attack on the Durmand Priory. If he fires the Sonic Vaporizer, it wont't just destroy the Priory walls and kill Ogden Stonehealer: it will also attract a horde of ice dragon minions. As Eir suggested, I permanently joined an order and committed to stopping this threat as a first step toward confronting the Elder Dragons themselves. Ifwyn and I rescued the missing Order of Whispers agent and determined that the Vyacheslav's Sonic Vaporizer not only does incredible damage to its target, it also attracts all ice dragon minions in the vicinity. We rushed back to Hoelbrak with this information for Eir and the other reps. I met with Eir and the orders of Tyria to plan how we'd stop Vyacheslav's mad attack on the Durmand Priory. If he fires the Sonic Vaporizer, it won't just destroy the Priory walls and kill Ogden Stonehealer: it will also attract a horde of ice dragon minions. As Eir suggested, I permanently joined an order and committed to stopping this threat as a first step toward confronting the Elder Dragons themselves. Crusader Thurkill and I stormed the dredge facility at Molenheide. We took out Vyacheslav's prototype weapon, which looks like an incredibly destructive sonic cannon. We also found evidence that an even bigger cannon is under construction, so we headed back to Hoelbrak to inform Eir and the other order reps. I reported to the order reps that the dredge leader Vyacheslav has a powerful new sonic weapon, which he plans to use on a specific target. After a brief debate we decided to identify and protect the final target.";

allStories+=" Agent Ifwyn and I infiltrated the Molenheide dredge mine and brought back key parts of the prototype sonic cannon for study. We took this information back to the order reps in Hoelbrak to decide on our next move. I reported what Ifwyn and I found at Molenheide to Eir and the order reps. We agreed that Vyacheslav's new sonic cannon is too dangerous, so we set out to deprive him of it. I joined Crusader Thurkill to investigate a missing Vigil Squad in dredge territory. We found them, killed by a new kind of weapon Thrukill had never seen before. We decided to return to the other order reps to confer. Thurkill and I told the other order reps about the missing Vigil squad's fate and the evidence we saw of a new dredge weapon. We discussed our options and decided to collect more evidence about the dredge's new toy. I joined Scholar Prott of the Durmand Priory to defend Scholar's Cleft from a dredge attack. We saved the faculty and staff, but the dredge leader Vyacheslav stole a book on ancient architecture. Prott and I decided to return to Hoelbrak to confer with the other order reps. I answered Eir's call to help settle a dispute between the Orders of Tyria, right at her homestead. The Orders of Tyria were concerned about a sudden increase in violent dredge activities with a new type of weapon. I agreed to work with the orders to find out what the dredge are doing and how to stop it. I brought my ancestor's horn back to the Great Lodge, only to fight off the Sons of Svanir who'd followed us for the horn. Eir and I defeated them, but at the cost of the horn itself. With the horn shattered, I'm even more dedicated to upholding the legacy of my ancestor, the great hero explorer Romke. I decided that Romke's horn was too corrupted and must be destroyed. The kodan had a way to rip out the horn's power, but the horn summoned terrifying creatures to defend itself. In the end, we prevailed. I hated to lose this heirloom from my ancestor, but now the Sons of Svanir can no longer use it for darkness. Eir, Garm, and Followed by Night joined me in confronting the Son of Svanir who cheated me out of an heirloom. We defeated Varg and recovered my ancestor's horn. As Romke's descendant, and the horn's rightful owner, I decide what to do with it. After proving our worth against a common enemy, the kodan Followed by Night told us Romke's horn was being kept at the Sons of Svanir camp near Drakentelt. Eir called me in to meet with Fastulf Jotharsson, Hoelbrak's Speaker of Wolf. Fastulf has had a vision of fiery doom for Krennak, a rugged frontier-dweller and old friend of Eir's. Eir and I are going out to Krennak's homestead to check him. Eir and I visited Krennak's Homestead and identified the danger he faces: a Son of Svanir named Varg is summoning monstrous creatures with a powerful horn. Worst of all, the horn is mine. I lost this important family heirloom to Varg at a recent moot without knowing how dangerous it was. Now Eir and I are determined to get the horn back. I sparred with Eir, both physically and verbally, and she taught me a lesson - a very important lesson - about taking what I've learned so far and using it to prepare for my showdown with Mikkel Toivosson. I'm ready now, in both body and mind. On to the championship! I defeated Mikkel Toivosson to become the new Big Brawl champion. It felt great to avenge my earlier defeat and repair the damage done to my reputation, but it feels even better knowing that Knut Whitebear and Eir both think I'm the kind of champion who will inspire the people of Hoelbrak. I traveled to charr territory and won the semifinals of the Big Brawl. Knut opened this competition up to fighters of all races, from all over the world. I had to beat a centaur, a sylvari, and a charr—no easy task, but in the end I managed to defeat them all. I'm almost ready to face Mikkel Toivosson, but first I need to speak with Eir. For Knut's special challenge, I chose to help a popular merchant, named Hekka, by clearing out a murellow infestation that's ruining her business. They were savage, diseased beasts, but I bested them all, and Hekka gave me her token as proof of my success. I can only advance to the semifinals if I present the token at the Big Brawl's next round before my opponent arrives. For Knut's special challenge, I chose Nollarr and his followers, Sons of Svanir who have been a problem near Svanir's Dome. The Sons fought with all their might, but I bested them and took Nollarr's prized helm for proof. I can only advance to the semifinals if I bring in the helm before my opponent arrives. I spoke with Eir and she told me about a great opportunity to get even with my most hated rival, Mikkel Toivosson. Whoever makes it to the finals of this year's Big Brawl gets to fight Mikkel for the championship. Mikkel once humiliated me in a fight, so defeating him is the only way to restore my legend and reputation. I participated in the Big Brawl's qualifying round, a free-for-all open to all norn. I was one of two winners, and now we both have to compete a special challenge to determine who moves on to the semifinals. I welcome this test_each victory brings me closer to a shot at Mikkel Toivosson. The Gear Warband and I defeated the Ascalonian ghosts in Grendich Ruins and took out their leader. My debt is now more than paid. The Gear Warband and I fought our way into Moledavia and recovered the missing charr chugger. Now Legionnaire Geargrind has invited me to join the warband for a major attack on the ghosts. I helped the Gear Warband set up a successful ambush. We defeated the dredge and recovered the missing vehicle. Legionnaire Geargrind invited me to join the warband for a major attack on the ghosts. I helped the Gear Warband defend Crossroads Haven from a grawl attack. Afterwards, we got a lead on the missing machine. The dredge took it, so we going to get it back. The Gear Warband is missing their chugger attack vehicle. Since I share blame for losing it, I've agreed to serve as a temporary auxiliary and repay the loss. My first duty as a soldier is to join their caravan escort detail. As a temporary auxiliary member of the Gear Warband, I helped defend a charr caravan bound to Twinspur Haven. We also got a lead on the missing chugger: it was last seen heading for Crossroads Haven, so that's the next stop. Along with Eir and Garm, I defeated the Sons of Svanir. We couldn't save Wolf Havroun Solvi's life, but we did release his spirit and close the Sons of Svanir portal to the Mists. With order restored to the Spirit World and Valda assuming the role of the Wolf Havroun, we're ready to meet whatever challenges lay ahead. Eir and I recruited another powerful havroun and went back into the Mists for Valda. We found her battling the Sons of Svanir and helped her defeat them. Valda explained that she and her master Solvi had been attacked while they were out of body, trapping her spirit in the Mists. Now she's desperate to find Solvi in this world, and we're going to help her. Eir and I found Raven Havroun Weibe and helped him recover a stolen Raven shrine artifact from the dredge caves. In return, Weibe is going to join us when we return to the Mists to confront the Sons of Svanir. We're going to make those dragon-worshipping brutes tell us what happened to Valda and Solvi, and then we're going to make them pay for invading the Mists. Eir and I found Bear Havroun Grechen and with her defended a caravan against a Sons of Svanir ambush. In return, she's taking us into the Mists to confront the Sons of Svanir and find out what happened to Valda. Havround Svena took Eir and me into the Mists to investigate Valda's illness. When we arrived there, we were attacked by the Sons of Svanir! This must be what Valda was ranting about. I need to see if she can tell us any more about what happened to her. Valda still can't tell us what happened to her in the Mists, so Havroun Svena suggested we seek help from one of the other havrouns. I gave the bards something new to sing about by helping the people of Wayfarer Hills. I also received a message from Wolf Shaman Gamli, seeking my help. I'm on my way to see him now. Soon everybody will know my name! Wolf Shaman Gamli needs me to help with the stricken Wolf Havroun's apprentice, Valda. She's stuck in a deep, restless sleep and cannot be roused. Gamli asked me to acquire a medicinal plant called winter sage that he can use to wake Valda up so we can find out what happened to her and her master. I retrieved the Winter Sage from the grawl caves and taught the grawl a lesson about getting in my way when I'm on a mission of mercy. Wolf Shaman Gamli is waiting in Hoelbrak so he can use it to help the stricken Wolf Havroun's apprentice, Valda. The winter sage revived Valda, but she kept ranting incoherently about 'invaders' in the Mists. Eir Stegalkin and I are going to consult with Svena, the Snow Leopard Havroun, to find out more. I hunted down prey for the Great Hunt, presented my trophies to the judges, and celebrated with my fellow hunters at the moot. Then I battled and defeated Issormir, the giant ice wurm. These victories earned me glory, and the right to call myself 'Slayer of Issormir.' Soon every norn in Hoelbrak will be talking about me! I spoke with Eir and we set to confront the Sons of Svanir leader, Vidkun. He may have a dragon minion on his side, but we have Minotaur himself. Together, we'll stop Vidkun's attacks on Minotaur and his kind. Along with Eir, Garm, and the Minotaur Spirit, I defeated Vidkun and his corrupted dragon minion. Eir and I disguised ourselves as beer merchants to get closer to the Sons of Svanir. We got the Sons good and drunk and freed the minotaurs before any more were fed to a dragon minion. Now we're going to put a stop to their minotaur hunt once and for all. It was strange being a minotaur. I used the shape as an effective disguise—I not only freed the trapped minotaurs, but also thrashed the Sons of Svanir! Now I just need to return to Eir and speak of my success. Eir and I tracked the Sons of Svanir and stopped them from harming the Spirit of Minotaur. The Sons have been hunting down minotaurs to feed them to some sort of dragon minion being kept by their master Vidkun. We came up with a plan to release the captured minotaurs before any more are sacrificed to Vidkun's monster. I tracked the Minoaur Spirit up into the mountains to the north. I found a group of Sons of Svanir. It turns out they've been capturing minotaurs and feeding them to a dragon minion. This has to stop! I interrogated one of the Sons of Svanir and discovered their ultimate goal is to capture the Spirit of Minotaur and feed it to their leader's pet dragon minion. Eir and I are determined to stop them, so we need to find Minotaur first. I gave the bards something new to sing about by helping the people of Wayfarer Hills. I also received a message from Ferghen the Tracker, seeking my help. I'm on my way. Soon everybody will know my name! Eir and I defended a caravan. The minotaurs were acting very strangely. Ferghen the Tracker thinks the Spirit of the Wild, Minotaur, has come to Tyria. I plan to track this creature and find out what's going on. I defeated the jotun's would-be giant-king Korag. Without him, his followers abandoned their worship of Jormag. The jotun are still determined to claim norn lands as their own, so they're still a threat, but at least they won't be fighting for the Sons of Svanir. Fastulf Jotharsson, the Speaker of Wolf, told me about a powerful wolf that has been corrupted by the Sons of Svanir. Called Ormi, he's running wild and posing a danger to the entire region. Together, Eir and I will find this wounded wolf and release his spirit. With Eir's help, I pull the corrupted wolf Ormi out of his misery and released his troubled spirit. The Sons of Svanir will pay for corrupting one of Wolf's favorites. Fastulf Jotharsson thanked us for releasing Ormi's spirit and punishing the Sons of Svanir who corrupted him. He also promised us a blessing from Wolf when we face Korag. I met Eir at the summit of a great mountain and, with her help, I defeated the fearsome griffon Windshear. I've bathed the axe in its blood, as Beigarth requested. Now all that remains is to return the weapon to him so he may temper it a final time. I bathed the axe in Windshear's blood and returned it to Beigarth. He was impressed and told me he would finish work on it at once, then send it along with Eir when we set off to take down Korag. I can hardly wait to wield it. After seeing the history of the jotun, I took pity on their leader and offered him a chance to discover the truth. If he still serves Jormag when I see him again, I will destroy him. Eir and Beigarth both agree that I need a way to fight Korag. Eir suggests I seek Wolf's blessing. Beigarth wants blood from the heart of a mighty predator to enrich his new weapon. Either of these should give me the edge I need. Eir and I tried to talk to the Sons of Svanir, but they insisted on fighting. Afterwards, we forced them to tell us what they're up to: manipulating the jotun leader Korag so he'll force his people to worship the ice dragon Jormag. Eir went to pursue another lead, but I'm going to track down Korag and take him out myself. I gave the bards something new to sing about by helping the people of Wayfarer Hills. I also received a mesage from Beigarth the Smith, seeking my help. I'm on my way. Soon everybody will know my name!nBeigarth the Smith is starting a new project, and he wants my help. He swears his new blade will be able to cut mountains in half, but it requires a special type of metal that can only be found in the jotun-infested caves near Hoelbrak. This will be a chance for me to test my might and earn Beigarth's favor. I bested the jotun in the cave. Recovering Beigarth's steel was simpler once they were out of the way, but I'm troubled by the shrine to Jormag I saw there. The jotun seem to have been worshipping it. Beigarth will want to know more. I collected the steel Beigarth needs to forge his weapon, but I also saw jotun in the caves, worshipping at an altar to the ice dragon Jormag! I'm going to tell Eir Stegalkin about this - nobody has more experience battling Jormag's corruption than her. I told Eir about the jotun worshipping Jormag and, as I'd hoped, she wanted to look into it immediately. The Sons of Svanir are always trying to spread Jormag's influence, so Eir and I are headed to their camp to get some answers. Mazdak the Accursed is destroyed and Riannoc's spirit can finally rest in peace. I returned Caladbolg to the Pale Tree, but perhaps one day, I will see the sword again. Meanwhile, I've joined the Vigil/Order of Whispers/Durmand Priory. I look forward to seeing more of this world. Mazdak the Accursed is destroyed. Riannoc's spirit can finally rest in peace. I returned Cladbolg to the Pale Tree, but perhaps one day, I will see the sword again. Meanwhile, I've joined the Order of Whispers. I look forward to seeing more of the world. Mazdak the Accursed is destroyed. Riannoc's spirit can finally rest in peace. I returned Caladbolg to the Pale Tree, but perhaps one day, I will see the sword again. Meanwhile, I've joined the Durmand Priory. I look forward to seeing more of the world. Where strength and logic can't prevail, good old-fashioned cunning can win the day. Waine never knew what hit him. The Order of Whispers is thorough, I'll give them that. I boldly engaged in a pit-fighting competition, and through courage and skill, defeated Waine and reclaimed the Pale Tree's sword. Riannoc is avenged on his betrayer at last! I fought beside Riannoc, and saw him betrayed by his human squire, Waine. It is truly a tragedy that Riannoc's trust was so misplaced. I wonder where the boy took the sword, Caladbolg, when he fled the swamp. The bandit, Jat, confessed that he knew where to find Waine. He's fighting as a gladiator under an assumed name, using Caladbolg to be unbeatable. For now... Overlake Haven was saved, but I saw a strange and terrible creature among the undead. No one there had ever seen anything like it. I wonder what that portends? I returned and told the Pale Tree about the creature I saw. Trahearne believes it is a lich called Mazdak the Accursed. Mazdak was involved in the death of Firstborn Riannoc, the first sylvari to die. The Pale Tree had given Riannoc a magic sword formed from her own thorns, but with Riannoc's disappearance, the sword has never been found. The Pale Tree has asked me to recover the sword, Caladbolg, and find out what happened to Riannoc. Overlake Haven was saved, but I saw a strange and terrible creature among the undead. No one there had ever seen anything like it. I wonder what that portends? I returned and told the Pale Tree about the creature I saw. Trahearne believes it is a lich called Mazdak the Accursed. Mazdak was involved in the death of Firstborn Riannoc, the first sylvari to die. The Pale Tree had given Riannoc a magic sword formed from her own thorns, but with Riannoc's disappearance, the sword has never been found. The Pale Tree has asked me to recover the sword, Caladbolg, and find out what happened to Riannoc. Caithe has called me home, to help her investigate some trouble. I shall seek out the Pale Tree and see how I can be of service. The undead threat at Overlake Haven must be addressed, before more innocents are killed. The Pale Tree has left it in my hands to decide how to handle the problem. We silenced the Knight of Embers before she could tell the Nightmare Court Malyck's secret: he is from another tree. The implications are staggering. Malyck has gone into the Maguuma to seek his true origin. I hope one day, we will meet again. Trahearne's hermit friend, Amaranda, discovered the truth about Malyck—and whatever it is, Trahearne is very concerned. Caithe, Malyck, and I discovered Malyck's pod in Venlin Vale. Although it was similar to those from the Pale Tree...there was something very different about it. The Knight of Embers discovered this information as well, and now we must stop her before she carries that news to the Nightmare Court. Malyck and I saved the Falias Thorp wardens who had been captured by the Nightmare Court. After listening to Trahearne and Caithe discuss our options, Malyck and I figured out a course of action. We must discover the truth of his past, before the Nightmare Court can use it against him. I met Caithe at Dreamer's Terrace, and she introduced me to Firstborn Trahearne. News arrived that the Nightmare Court are attacking several outposts, seeking something they call 'the harbinger'. I volunteered to aid the outpost of Falias Thorp. I only hope I'm not too late. At Falias Thorp I met a mysterious sylvari, named Malyck. Together, we were able to rally the fallen wardens and drive off the Nightmare Court. Many of the wardens were kidnapped, including their leader, Captain Banya. It's very strange...Malyck doesn't seem to have any memory of the Grove, or the Dream. I wanted to take him to the Pale Tree, but he was insistent about saving his kidnapped friends. Now, it's off to Joy's End to save the wardens and make the Nightmare Court pay for this attack. I told Trahearne about the Ogotl hylek and their Eye of the Sun, and he was very concerned. We decided to take immediate action. We're going to find the Ogotl and stop their devious plan. We defeated the Ogotl chieftain, cleaned up the river, and found the missing twin. Thank the Tree, the Caledon will be safe. I've invited Arlon and Pellam to stay in my garden while they recover from the wounds the hylek inflicted upon them both. Pellam and I tricked the Dengatl. We discovered that they've been working with the Ogotl, a mystic tribe with dire plans for the zalisco extract. I don't know what the Eye of the Sun is...but I'm betting it's not good. Arlon and I successfully raided the Dengatl hylek. We discovered that they've been working with the Ogotl, a mystic tribe who have dire plans for the zalisco extract. I don't know what the Eye of the Sun is...but I'm betting it's not good. We're on the right track, but the twins won't stop bickering. If they'd just work together, they could be an amazing team. Our path is clear, but only one twin will be assisting me. The two got in a huge fight, and refused to work together. If all sylvari acted like this, we'd never have built the Grove! Caithe introduced me to another firstborn name Trahearne. His Wyld Hunt involves Orr as well. Strangely, Caithe seemed to be very gentle with him—far more so than I've seen her with the other sylvari. She treats him like a little brother! Anyway, he had a job for me: to go help a pair of sylvari twins barter with the hylek. I met with the twins and the hylek, but everything went to brambles. Dengatl hylek ambushed us and stole the poison we were supposed to transport. I'd better pull us all out of this mess before things get worse. Orr is a dark and ugly place. Tegwen is safe...but we are all greatly sobered by the experience. Is my future truly to defeat the master of that horrible land? Although Tegwen is safe, the mirror's visions of Orr have shaken me. It's not just knowing how bad that place is, but also knowing that one day my Wyld Hunt will call me there—to face Zhaitan himself! I hope I will be ready when that day comes. Orr is a dark and ugly place. Tegwen is safe...but we are all greatly sobered by the experience. Is my future truly to defeat the master of that horrible land? The mirror is dangerous! We got it back from the skritt, but as Tegwen was inspecting it, the magic activated and pulled her through a portal to Orr. We have to get her back! We rescued Tegwen! We also freed a hylek named Ehuatl, and an asura named Larra, who were also imprisoned. The item is a mirror from ancient Orr, but the skritt have stolen it. In a strange show of asuran kindness, Larra offered to help us get it back. Trahearne's friend, Tegwen, has gone missing while looking for an Orrian artifact. She was last seen with a sylvari named Carys, near the hamlet of Annwen. I helped Carys defend the beach. Tegwen was searching for the artifact in dangerous territory. She may have been captured by krait. We tried to save her, but nightmare would not release Ysvelta. Caithe was right—once you've fallen, there is no road back to the Dream. Poor Tiachren was forced to make a tragic decision, and is heartbroken. I will take him to the Mother Tree, to see if she can give him comfort. I spoke with the Pale Tree and told her about Tiachren and Ysvelta. I asked her about the Dream, and she told me that only two sylvari have ever dreamed of facing the dragons head-on—me, and Caithe. I wonder what that means? Nevertheless, the Mother was proud of me, and I look forward to my next adventure. Ysvelta was clearly a lost cause, so I chose to save the village. Tiachren and Ysvelta showed up, shrouded in nightmare, and I was forced to kill them. I spoke with the Pale Tree and told her about Tiachren and Ysvelta. I asked her about the Dream, and she told me that only two sylvari have ever dreamed of facing the dragons head-on—me, and Caithe. I wonder what that means? Nevertheless, the Mother was proud of me, and I look forward to my next adventure. After a daring attempt at rescue, we discovered that the unthinkable has happened — Ysvelta, Tiachren's beloved, has been corrupted by the Nightmare Court. Can she be freed from their influence? And if we try — will the village of Astorea suffer, because we weren't there to defend against the court's next attack? Using a daring plan designed by Caithe, we broke the villain, Renvari, out of jail. Once he decided to trust me, I tricked him into telling me where the Nightmare Court is meeting. I think we'll find Ysvelta there. Together with Caithe and the wardens, I managed to protect Caer Verdant and stop the Nightmare Court from recapturing Renvari. Now, we must find a way to make him tell us what he knows. I helped the people of Caledon Forest, and saw many things. These lands are much like my Dream, and there is an even bigger world beyond! Tyria, they call it. One day, I will explore, and discover it all. I spoke with Mender Aviala, and asked how to find antidote for the poison Caithe mentioned. It's so rare that I will have to steal it from the trolls. The trolls were none too willing to give up their salve, but I was determined. I hope this is what Aviala needs. The troll goo was...icky. But it seems to be what Mender Aviala needed to make the antidote. I hope this works. Thanks to the antidote, Tiachren has recovered from the Nightmare Court poison. He told us that his lady, Ysvelta, had been kidnapped by the Nightmare Court. We'll have to find her quickly, if we are to rescue her. Nightmare's poison has withdrawn from the Dream. I met with Bercilak at Mabon Market and challenged him to another duel. This time, I was prepared for the advantage of his armor. Bercilak has been destroyed, and will never hurt anyone else. I spoke with the Pale Tree and told her about defeating Bercilak. I asked her about the Dream, and she told me that only two sylvari have ever dreamed of facing the dragons head-on—me, and Caithe. I wonder what that means? Nevertheless, the Mother was proud of me, and I look forward to my next adventure. Gairwen has agreed to trick Bercilak into removing his helmet. It is difficult for her to do this, but Caithe and I convinced her that it was the only way to defeat Bercilak and end his cruel games. We found and rescued Occam. Thankfully we made it in time and spared him from falling into nightmare. On Gairwen's advice, I sought out the smith that created Bercilak's green armor. To my surprise, he's been kidnapped by the Nightmare Court! I traveled to Morgan's Spiral to meet Gairwen, Bercilak's current love interest. He killed her true love, and she hates him with a passion. After I helped defend her love's grave, she told me that Bercilak's armor made him powerful. To find out how, I will seek the armorsmith who forged it. As I met with Caithe and the leader of my cycle, there was a disturbance in the Grove. Strangely enough, it was a sylvari dressed in green armor, much as I had seen in my Dream! I must investigate, and discover what it is I am meant to do. I fought off Sariel's cronies and faced Gavin in an honorable duel. Whatever else these Nightmare Court members may be, not all of them are dishonorable. I spoke with the Pale Tree and told her about the white stag. I asked her about the Dream, and she told me that only two sylvari have ever dreamed of facing the dragons head-on—me, and Caithe. I wonder what that means? Nevertheless, the Mother was proud of me, and I look forward to my next adventure. I created a distraction and challenged Sariel of the Nightmare Court, while Caithe snuck through their campsite at Hemlock Coil. With a little defiance and a lot of good fortune, the white stag is free again. Now we will take it to the Grove, where the stag will be safe. Caithe and I stole some courtiers' robes, and infiltrated the Nightmare Court campsite at Hemlock Coil. With a little stealth and a lot of good fortune, the white stag is free again. Now we will take it to the Grove, where the stag will be safe. Caithe and I learned the Nightmare Court's plans. Gavin intends terrible things for the white stag. We must stop him. I tracked and found the white stag, but in my moment of triumph, Gavin betrayed me and escaped with the poor creature. I was wrong to trust him, even though he seemed so honorable. Caithe thinks we should spy on the Nightmare Court. They'll know where Gavin has taken the white stag, and that might be our best hope to recover it. I helped the residents of Caledon Forest. A white stag has been seen in the Verdence. Just like in my Dream! I must find out what this means. Sylvari are spreading the tale of a white stag roaming the Caledon Forest. I dreamed of such a stag! He may be elusive, but I believe I can find him. While looking for the legendary white stag, I came upon a hunter named Gavin. I rescued him from trouble, and he offered to help with my quest. ";
//forging the pact + after;
allStories+="At Trahearne's request, I joined him in Concordia to discuss preparing the Pact's campaign into Orr to confront Zhaitan. I met with Trahearne and some high-ranking members of the orders of Tyria. We confirmed Trahearne as the leader of the Pact, with the rank of marshal. We also agreed that I would be Trahearne's second in command with the rank of commander. We put the finest smiths in Tyria to work making weapons and armor for the Pact, and Trahearne led a rescue mission that not only saved the lives of stranded Pact soldiers, but also netted us a valuable dwarven tome of ancient knowledge. The Pact's campaign plans are broad and complicated, so Trahearne asked me to make sure a key element of that campaign is ready for the rigors of war. I met one of the Pact's premier explosive experts, an asura named Tonn. I helped Tonn take down a set of Orrian siege towers and discovered just how good he is (and how much he enjoys his work). We need a more powerful explosive to destroy the Orrian bone ship, so Tonn and I set out to acquire one. Tonn and I raided an Inquest lab for the potent explosives we need to sink the bone ship, and then we left to meet our support squad on the shores of the Mire Sea. Tonn and I spoke with the krewe working inside Mount Maelstrom and collected their flame core, which will serve as the potent explosive we need to sink the bone ship. From there, we went to meet our support squad on the shores of the Mire Sea. Tonn's skill and bravery allowed us to sink the bone ship, but it cost him his life. When a mechanical failure prevented the charges from detonating, Tonn put himself at risk to make sure they went off. He succeeded, but was unable to get clear of the blast. His sacrifice saved hundreds of lives, but that won't be much comfort to his friends, his family, or those of us who fought beside him. I helped Trahearne and the Pact defeat a major attack against Fort Trinity. The dragon sent its army at us from all directions, but we were able to hold them off. Now the Pact is poised to go on the offensive and take the fight to Zhaitan in Orr—but first, I have to finish the mission I started at Trahearne's request. I delivered the bad news about Tonn to his widow, Ceera. As a Pact medic, she deals with death every day, but that didn't make Tonn's heroic sacrifice any easier to hear. In her grief, she blamed me for Tonn's death and ran off, straight into a throng of undead. I was able to rescue her, but she remained furious and refused to forgive me. I can only hope that our eventual victory over the dragons will make Ceera see that Tonn's bravery saved countless lives and helped secure Tyria's freedom. Something went horribly wrong. I reported to Warmaster Caisson's artillery unit to assist them with their mission. I was put in charge of a mortar team's fire mission, but when the smoke cleared, I saw we had been shelling our own troops. How could this have happened? I know I saw the enemy when I gave the order to fire. This could have catastrophic effects on the newly formed Pact's chain of command, so I decided my top priority is getting to the bottom of this. I rescued the surviving members of Tactician Syska's squad from Mount Maelstrom. It was far from a routine mission, however, since someone set up an ambush designed to kill us deep inside the mountain. Even Syska's own soldiers suspected her, and I set out to find Trahearne to tell him the Pact may have a traitor in its midst. I looked into Tactician Syska's background, hoping to find clues about her involvement in my friendly fire incident that killed Pact troops. One of the soldiers in Syska's unit said she spent a lot of time in a Black Citadel tavern, so I decided to continue my investigation there. Barkeep Gallowknot knew Syska as one of his regular customers. He told me about the mysterious meetings Syska routinely held in his tavern, and steered me towards a soldier name Ignavus Ridgerunner. I set out to find Ignavus and solve this mystery before any more Pact soldiers get hurt. When I questioned Ignavus, he confessed that he and Syska had been selling Pact weaponry and supplies on the black market. The last time he saw her was at a secret meeting with the Flame Legion near Onager Bivouac, which became my next stop. I found the camp where Syska was seen doing black market business with the Flame Legion. When I tried to investigate, I was confronted and attacked by a series of baffling mesmer illusions. Whoever cast the illusions was determined to keep me out, but I prevailed and gained access to the camp. I found tactician Syska's body and realized the 'Syska' I've met must be a disguised mesmer. The Pact can't afford an enemy agent embedded so high up in the chain of command, so I set out to send word to Trahearne before the impostor can do any more damage. Syska's former partner in crime, Ignavus, was only too happy to send word to Trahearne on my behalf. He hoped that helping me would count in his favor if his black market weapons deals ever came to light, but my only concern was protecting Trahearne and the Pact from the impostor's illusory attacks. I set out to Oxbow Isle so I can talk to Trahearne face to face. I met Trahearne at Oxbow Isle and reported my suspicions that 'Syska' is a mesmer in the service of Zhaitan. We were attacked as soon as I presented my concerns, but I was able to stop the mesmer's assassination attempt. This matter will have to wait, however, as Trahearne told me Fort Trinity is being targeted for a major assault by Zhaitan's forces. I agreed to meet Trahearne back at For Trinity to prepare for this assault. Trahearne and I confronted the false 'Syska' who had been using her illusions to sow discord and confusion among the Pact ranks. She was the source of the illusions that tricked me into firing on friendly Pact troops. With Trahearne's help, I defeated the mesmer and cleared the way for the Pact's assault on Orr to begin. Crusader Apatia and I attacked the krait slavers in their tower fortress. We defeated the krait and freed their prisoners, including Warden Hywel. The prisoners told us of a krait orb with the ability to prevent Zhaitan's magic from raising the dead, and of a largos who might have more answers. Apatia and I set out to find this largos in order to learn as much as we can about this strange and powerful artifact. Apatia and I tracked down Sayeh al'Rajihd, the largos we'd been told about. Sayeh gave us a challenge to prove we were worth her time, which we met. She then told us what she knew about the orb. Its origins, purpose, and true power are still a mystery, but we did learn where it will be, so Apatia and I set out to claim it for the Pact. Apatia and I allowed ourselves to be taken prisoner by krait slavers so we could get close to the orb. Everything went perfectly until I found and claimed the orb. The krait recaptured Apatia, but I couldn't stop to free her. The orb and I are both needed back at Fort Trinity. I swore to return and rescue Apatia. Apatia and I ambushed the krait caravan that transports their mysterious orb. I was able to defeat the krait and recover the orb, but Apatia was captured and carried off. Both the orb and I are needed back at Fort Trinity, so I swore to return and rescue Apatia. Trahearne joined me and others in storming the krait tower to rescue Apatia. We made it through, but we were too late. Like every krait we encountered, Apatia had been turned into one of the undead. It was a devastating find, but we agreed that the thing she had become needed to be put down. Afterwards, we set out for Hoelbrak to formally remember Apatia for what she truly was: a hero. Trahearne and I gave Crusader Apatia a hero's send-off. We traveled to the Great Lodge in Hoelbrak and shared tales of her courage and skill with the norn assembled there. Apatia will not be forgotten by the Pact or her people—and when Zhaitan falls, we will dedicate our victory to Apatia and the other brave soldiers whose sacrifice made our victory possible. The largos, Sayeh al' Rahjid, swore to honor a mysterious oath she made to Trahearne in the past. Acting on her information, we decided I would join her in investigating a sunken temple off Orr's coast. We arrived too late to stop Zhaitan's servants from claiming a powerful artifact, but we killed one of the dragon's lieutenants and collected some valuable information. The creatures we saw seem connected to Zhaitan itself and also seem to be acting on its top priorities. Sayeh and I returned to Trahearne to figure out how to use this new intelligence. I reported back to Fort Trinity to tell Trahearne about the strange eye and mouth creatures we saw. Trahearne seemed to recognize the eye as the Eye of Zhaitan, which was acting as the dragon's advance scout. We set out to kill this creature in the hopes of blinding Zhaitan's war effort. Trahearne and I needed a powerful magical artifact to attract the Eye of Zhaitan, so we turned to Carys and Tegwen, two sylvari Wardens who had discovered a magic Orrian mirror. The trap worked. Trahearne sent the Eye's body back to be studied by the Pact's foremost authorities in order to determine what it is and how we can use it against Zhaitan. Trahearne and I led a strike team into Orr to storm the last known location of the Eye of Zhaitan. With the help of some new recruits, we were able to reach the eye and kill it. Trahearne is determined to learn all he can about this strange creature as a prelude to attacking Zhaitan itself. Trahearne had the dead Eye of Zhaitan returned to Fort Trinity for study, and he requested I join him there. I returned to the Fort Trinity airship docks and boarded the airship to conduct the study. I joined Trahearne, Professor Gorr and Scholar Vivian aboard a Pact airship to conduct tests on the dead Eye of Zhaitan without endangering anyone in Fort Trinity. We established that the Eye literally sees for Zhaitan, and we saw horrific images of Orr. We identified another monstrous creature called the Mouth of Zhaitan and agreed that if the Eye finds food for the dragon, then the Mouth must consume it. We set out for Orr itself to prevent the Mouth from providing sustenance to Zhaitan. I led a Pact squad into Orr to take out the Mouth of Zhaitan that was operating in Kitah Manse. We fought through the corrupted lord of the manse's illusions, killed him and his undead servants, and disposed of the Mouth, but we lost good soldiers in the process. Without the Mouth, Zhaitan's food supply has been curtailed. I returned to Fort Trinity to check in with Marshal Trahearne and plan the Pact's next move. I met with Marshal Trahearne and decided the Pact's next step was to cut off the supply of corpses that Zhaitan corrupts into soldiers for its army. I led a Pact squad on a mission to destroy the ship and the couriers that bring magical objects to the Mouth of Zhaitan. Our intent was to cut off Zhaitan's food supply by starving its Mouth, but the Mouth itself emerged and we were forced to kill it directly. I returned to Fort Trinity to meet with Trahearne and plan the Pact's next move. I met with Marshal Trahearne and decided the Pact's next step was to cut off the supply of dead bodies that Zhaitan corrupts into soldiers for its army. I boarded a submarine at Fort Trinity and set out to find and sink the ark that provides Zhaitan with the corpses required to create Risen monstrosities. I led a mission to sink the giant ark that provides Zhaitan with fresh corpses. We planted ghostfire charges aboard the ark and narrowly escaped as the magical conflagration destroyed the ark and everything on it. Now that we've crippled Zhaitan's surveillance, food supply, and troop strength, the Pact moved forward to establish a major beachhead in Orr itself. Trahearne and I led a mission into Zhaitan's ossuary to destroy the horrid process used to create Risen monstrosities. The ossuary was heavily defended, but we were able to shut it down. Now that we've crippled Zhaitan's surveillance, food supply, and ability to create reinforcements, it's time to press the advantage and establish a major beachhead in Orr. We established a forward command post for the Pact at Reflection Cove. We defended it from the ravages of a Risen prince, and it will be a critical part of our advancement into Orr. I went looking for a missing Pact squad and found Ferghen, once the Pact's premier scout, now corrupted and hunting his fellow squadmates in a lethal game of cat-and-mouse. We defeated him, but not without serious casualties. I also learned that Ferghen's squad had located a powerful weapon that the Pact could employ against Zhaitan's army: a Searing Cauldron, much like the one that destroyed Ascalon centuries ago. We set out to collect that weapon. Wearing a golem battlesuit prototype, I was dropped near the Cathedral of Zephyrs to secure a Searing Cauldron. Pact pilot Arda Gyreshriek, who delivered me to the site, made sure I had assistance against the Risen ground forces while Laranthir of the Wild led a support team after I cleared the zone. With their help, I was able to clear out the cauldron's Risen defenders and claim this powerful weapon for the Pact. I took part in the mission to airlift the Searing Cauldron into Orr and fire it off against Zhaitan's army. The mission was a success, but only due to the bravery and sacrifice of our pilot, Arda Gyreshriek. Arda went missing after the blast, so Laranthir of the Wild and I set out to find her and bring her home safely. We found Arda amid the wreckage of her airship, but the Risen had gotten to her first. I'm glad we had the chance to tell her that the mission succeeded before she died. We have little time to mourn her loss; the invasion of Orr is far from over. Laranthir promised to add Arda's name to the roster of honored dead while I returned to Trahearne for my next mission. It was madcap and a little bit arachnophobic, but our motley crew sabotaged the Orrian lighthouse. When the Dead Ships follow the guidance of Beacon Torch, they'll find themselves run aground. We boarded the Dead Ships, cleared out the undead, and captured the vessels. Once the Pact sailors retrofit the ships for use by living creatures, we'll be ready to sail our new ships right into the harbor of Arah. Using the ships we captured, we approached the docks of Arah unnoticed. Once in position, the Pact launched a significant strike inland and won the day, but not without a price. After a long battle with no reinforcements and no safe place to retreat to, we reached the docks and took control of the area. Now that the ships from Lion's Arch have landed, the war machines can begin their march toward the city of Arah. As part of the Pact's march on Orr, I led a squad charged with clearing a path for our heavy mobile artillery. We reached our destination, but lost a brave sylvari named Tegwen, who stayed behind to ensure our mission was successful. We mourned our loss, but prepared to move on to our next objective so our tanks could be put to good use. I met Tactician Beirne at Caer Shadowfain and defended the site against a Risen invasion from the sea. When the tanks arrived, we rolled on the main base of the undead. Although we were victorious, Beirne gave his life to save his friends. We won the day, but this victory has been paid for by the losses of many good people. Trahearne and I led a mission into Orr's Royal Tombs in an attempt to cast the ritual that will cleanse the land of Zhaitan's corruption. We got results, but the results didn't last. We realized we needed to cast the ritual in a different location known as the Source of Orr, and so we set out to find this location. Within the Cathedral of Silence, we met with Grenth's avatar — the Seventh Reaper. It was too weakened to defend the temple from a powerful Risen, so we made an exchange: we defeated the Risen, and the Reaper gave us the information we were looking for. Apparently, there is an artesian well hidden beneath the mountain near Melandru's temple, the very spot where the gods first set foot upon Tyria. There, we'll find the source of Orr. Trahearne sent me to locate the ghost of the famous norn explorer, Romke, so that we might fight the Source of Orr and cleanse it. Legend has it that Romke had a magic map that could lead its owner anywhere, so I tracked down Romke's ghost and asked for his help. He didn't have the map, but he knew where it was. I agreed to meet him on the shores of the Mausollus Sea. He would help me find the map, and in so doing, allow him and his ghostly crew to escape their curse and move on to the Mists. With Trahearne's help and guidance from the ghost of the great norn explorer Romke, I recovered a magic map that will allow us to find the Source of Orr. With the map in hand, Trahearne should be able to cast his cleansing ritual and finally complete his Wyld Hunt task of reversing the corruption of Orr done by Zhaitan. To cleanse Zhaitan's corruption from Orr, we had to connect with the dying spirit of the land. After finding the source of Orr's magic, Trahearne performed a powerful ritual while I defended him. Now, the land has a chance to recover—once the dragon is destroyed. I returned to Fort Trinity after a hard-fought battle and found the celebrations already beginning. Only Trahearne was solemn about our victory. He knows that the purification of Orr will only last if the dragon is destroyed. Next time, my battle will be with Zhaitan itself — and I will be victorious. With the help of a reunited Destiny's Edge, the Pact was able to accomplish the impossible: the slaying of an Elder Dragon. Zhaitan has fallen, and while the Pact's work is far from over, we have achieved a major victory. We agreed to continue the fight against the remaining Elder Dragons after we take a moment to honor the fallen and celebrate this triumph. I returned to Fort Trinity and joined the assembly of soldiers, scholars, spies and citizens celebrating the fall of Zhaitan. The Pact stood triumphant, but we did not delude ourselves. Swarms of Risen still roam Tyria, and there are four more Elder Dragons to contend with. We knew that soon we would once again rise up to defend our world, but that didn't stop us from taking this opportunity to savor a well-earned victory.";
